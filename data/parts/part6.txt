<p>"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."

<p>His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="arrival" newWord="entrance" score="0.866">entrance</span> was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span> within <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="view" newWord="aspect" score="0.852">aspect</span> of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>order</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="order" newWord="form" score="0.828">form</span> to have the earliest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assurance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="assurance" newWord="impossibility" score="0.889">impossibility</span> of it, and after making his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>bow</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.8" formerWord="bow" newWord="watch" score="0.8">watch</span> as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.774" formerWord="carriage" newWord="knock" score="0.774">knock</span> turned into the Park, hurried <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span> with the great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="complaisance" score="0.829">complaisance</span>.

There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>son</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="son" newWord="daughter" score="0.842">daughter</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> Lord - - - -, and, to the great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="surprise" newWord="dejected" score="0.605">dejected</span> of all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span>, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him.

<p>Elizabeth had scarcely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> to disclaim all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>right</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.627" formerWord="right" newWord="manager" score="0.627">manager</span> to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compliment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.748" formerWord="compliment" newWord="duty" score="0.748">duty</span>, before their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>approach</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="approach" newWord="force" score="0.845">force</span> was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span>.

<p>Chapter 31 
<p>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="invitation" newWord="representing" score="0.777">representing</span> thither - - for while there were visitors in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span>, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="week" newWord="night" score="0.852">night</span> after the gentlemen's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="arrival" newWord="entrance" score="0.866">entrance</span>, that they were honoured by such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="attention" newWord="eye" score="0.7">eye</span>, and then they were merely asked on leaving <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>church</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.867" formerWord="church" newWord="wilderness" score="0.867">wilderness</span> to come there in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="evening" newWord="whole" score="0.802">whole</span>. For the last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="week" newWord="night" score="0.852">night</span> they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="daughter" newWord="son" score="0.842">son</span>.

Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ladyship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="ladyship" newWord="uncle" score="0.843">uncle</span> received them civilly, but it was plain that their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>company</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.633" formerWord="company" newWord="excusable" score="0.633">excusable</span> was by no means so acceptable as when she could get <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nobody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="nobody" newWord="somebody" score="0.743">somebody</span> else; and she was, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fact</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.692" formerWord="fact" newWord="concerned" score="0.692">concerned</span>, almost engrossed by her nephews, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.635" formerWord="speaking" newWord="lieutenant" score="0.635">lieutenant</span> to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.739" formerWord="person" newWord="woman" score="0.739">woman</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span>.

<p>"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is."
<p>"We are <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.635" formerWord="speaking" newWord="lieutenant" score="0.635">lieutenant</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>music</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="music" newWord="humanity" score="0.799">humanity</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>madam</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="madam" newWord="lizzy" score="0.859">lizzy</span>,"said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.

<p>"I am not afraid of you,"said he, smilingly. 
<p>"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,"cried Colonel Fitzwilliam."I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."
<p>"You shall hear then - - but prepare yourself for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> very dreadful.

<p>Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy: 
<p>"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.771" formerWord="advantage" newWord="necessity" score="0.771">necessity</span> of a London <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="master" newWord="assistance" score="0.797">assistance</span>.

<p>Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>writing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="writing" newWord="purposely" score="0.791">purposely</span> to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="business" newWord="spot" score="0.751">spot</span> into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>village</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="village" newWord="centre" score="0.927">centre</span>, when she was startled by a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ring</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.739" formerWord="ring" newWord="orchestra" score="0.739">orchestra</span> at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="door" newWord="table" score="0.864">table</span>, the certain <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>signal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.697" formerWord="signal" newWord="past" score="0.697">past</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="visitor" newWord="drawn" score="0.789">drawn</span>. As she had heard no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.774" formerWord="carriage" newWord="knock" score="0.774">knock</span>, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>apprehension</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="apprehension" newWord="consciousness" score="0.851">consciousness</span> was putting away her half-finished <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.59" formerWord="letter" newWord="first" score="0.59">first</span> that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="door" newWord="table" score="0.864">table</span> opened, and, to her very great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="surprise" newWord="dejected" score="0.605">dejected</span>, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span>. 
<p>He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intrusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.709" formerWord="intrusion" newWord="affection" score="0.709">affection</span> by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within. 
<p>They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>danger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="danger" newWord="possibility" score="0.776">possibility</span> of sinking into total <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.736" formerWord="silence" newWord="rising" score="0.736">rising</span>. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span>, and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span> of their hasty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>departure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.939" formerWord="departure" newWord="chief" score="0.939">chief</span>, she observed: 
<p>"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="surprise" newWord="dejected" score="0.605">dejected</span> to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span> before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?"
<p>"Perfectly so, I thank you."
<p>She found that she was to receive no other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.643" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.643">apology</span>, and, after a short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.647" formerWord="pause" newWord="watchful" score="0.647">watchful</span> added: 
<p>"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.701" formerWord="idea" newWord="consequence" score="0.701">consequence</span> of ever returning to Netherfield again?"
<p>"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> there in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>future</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.831" formerWord="future" newWord="walls" score="0.831">walls</span>. He has many friends, and is at a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>life</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.731" formerWord="life" newWord="opinion" score="0.731">opinion</span> when friends and engagements are continually increasing."
<p>"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span> that he should give up the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.653">house</span> entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span> there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span> so much for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>convenience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.926" formerWord="convenience" newWord="impression" score="0.926">impression</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span> as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>principle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.825" formerWord="principle" newWord="sound" score="0.825">sound</span>."
<p>"I should not be surprised,"said Darcy,"if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purchase</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.695" formerWord="purchase" newWord="writer" score="0.695">writer</span> offers."
<p>Elizabeth made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.643" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.643">apology</span>. She was afraid of talking longer of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span>; and, having <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> else to say, was now determined to leave the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trouble</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="trouble" newWord="offence" score="0.758">offence</span> of finding a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span> to him. 
<p>He took the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hint</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.659" formerWord="hint" newWord="drop" score="0.659">drop</span>, and soon began with,"This seems a very comfortable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span>. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.538" formerWord="deal" newWord="yawn" score="0.538">yawn</span> to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford."
<p>"I believe she did - - and I am sure she could not have bestowed her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kindness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="kindness" newWord="health" score="0.839">health</span> on a more grateful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.742" formerWord="object" newWord="evil" score="0.742">evil</span>."
<p>"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>choice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.853" formerWord="choice" newWord="belief" score="0.853">belief</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.789">son</span>."
<p>"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sensible</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.717" formerWord="sensible" newWord="amiable" score="0.717">amiable</span> women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span> has an excellent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>understanding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="understanding" newWord="health" score="0.857">health</span> - - though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span> she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>light</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="light" newWord="aspect" score="0.783">aspect</span> it is certainly a very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.691" formerWord="match" newWord="granted" score="0.691">granted</span> for her."
<p>"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="distance" newWord="ecclesford" score="0.747">ecclesford</span> of her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span> and friends."
<p>"An easy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="distance" newWord="ecclesford" score="0.747">ecclesford</span>, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."
<p>"And what is fifty miles of good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>road</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.941" formerWord="road" newWord="lane" score="0.941">lane</span>? Little more than half a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>journey</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.798" formerWord="journey" newWord="reflections" score="0.798">reflections</span>. Yes, I call it a very easy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="distance" newWord="ecclesford" score="0.747">ecclesford</span>."
<p>"I should never have considered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="distance" newWord="ecclesford" score="0.747">ecclesford</span> as one of the advantages of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.691" formerWord="match" newWord="granted" score="0.691">granted</span>,"cried Elizabeth."I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span>."
<p>"It is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proof</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="proof" newWord="instance" score="0.808">instance</span> of your own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="attachment" newWord="affection" score="0.743">affection</span> to Hertfordshire. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="Anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">Anybody</span> beyond the very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Longbourn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="Longbourn" newWord="rosings" score="0.89">Rosings</span>, I suppose, would appear far."
<p>As he spoke there was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.732" formerWord="sort" newWord="doer" score="0.732">doer</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.581" formerWord="smile" newWord="listening" score="0.581">listening</span> which Elizabeth fancied she <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>understood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="understood" newWord="guessed" score="0.875">guessed</span>; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered: 
<p>"I do not mean to say that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span> may not be settled too near her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span>. The far and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>near</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.608" formerWord="near" newWord="soon" score="0.608">soon</span> must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span> to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="distance" newWord="ecclesford" score="0.747">ecclesford</span> becomes no evil. But that is not the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="case" newWord="truth" score="0.799">truth</span> here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>income</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="income" newWord="understanding" score="0.794">understanding</span>, but not such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> as will allow of frequent journeys - - and I am persuaded my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span> would not call herself near her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span> under less than half the present <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="distance" newWord="ecclesford" score="0.747">ecclesford</span>."
<p>Mr. Darcy drew his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.873" formerWord="chair" newWord="neck" score="0.873">neck</span> a little towards her, and said,"You cannot have a right to such very strong local <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="attachment" newWord="affection" score="0.743">affection</span>. You cannot have been always at Longbourn."
<p>Elizabeth looked surprised. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="military" score="0.766">military</span> experienced some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>change</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.734" formerWord="change" newWord="necessity" score="0.734">necessity</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>feeling</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.723" formerWord="feeling" newWord="sunshine" score="0.723">sunshine</span>; he drew back his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.873" formerWord="chair" newWord="neck" score="0.873">neck</span>, took a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>newspaper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.835" formerWord="newspaper" newWord="sprang" score="0.835">sprang</span> from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="table" newWord="door" score="0.864">door</span>, and glancing over it, said, in a colder <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>voice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="voice" newWord="countenance" score="0.704">countenance</span>: 
<p>"Are you pleased with Kent?"
<p>A short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dialogue</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.88" formerWord="dialogue" newWord="events" score="0.88">events</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="country" newWord="neighbourhood" score="0.868">neighbourhood</span> ensued, on either <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.677" formerWord="side" newWord="board" score="0.677">board</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>calm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="calm" newWord="passive" score="0.778">passive</span> and concise - - and soon put an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="end" newWord="inn" score="0.675">inn</span> to by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>entrance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="entrance" newWord="departure" score="0.938">departure</span> of Charlotte and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mistake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="mistake" newWord="pity" score="0.827">pity</span> which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="anybody" newWord="myself" score="0.828">myself</span>, went away. 
<p>"What can be the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meaning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.727" formerWord="meaning" newWord="universal" score="0.727">universal</span> of this?"said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone."My dear, Eliza, he must be in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.53" formerWord="love" newWord="wise" score="0.53">wise</span> with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span>."
<p>But when Elizabeth told of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.736" formerWord="silence" newWord="rising" score="0.736">rising</span>; it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="case" newWord="truth" score="0.799">truth</span>; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="visit" newWord="longbourn" score="0.678">longbourn</span> to proceed from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>difficulty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="difficulty" newWord="motive" score="0.766">motive</span> of finding <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span> to do, which was the more probable from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="year" newWord="week" score="0.841">week</span>. All <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>field</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.881" formerWord="field" newWord="nation" score="0.881">nation</span> sports were over.

She supposed, if he meant <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span>, he must mean an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>allusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.698" formerWord="allusion" newWord="affording" score="0.698">affording</span> to what might arise in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quarter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="quarter" newWord="opportunity" score="0.807">opportunity</span>.

<p>"And what arts did he use to separate them?"
<p>"He did not talk to me of his own arts,"said Fitzwilliam, smiling."He only told me what I have now told you."
