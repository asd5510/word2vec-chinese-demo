<p>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.

<p>No <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>stay</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.764" formerWord="stay" newWord="brighton" score="0.764">brighton</span> would be so short; and she made the most of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> by visiting about with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="daughter" newWord="son" score="0.842">son</span>, and having very frequent parties at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span>.

<p>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="occasion" newWord="subject" score="0.703">subject</span>; no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> was to be put in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>competition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="competition" newWord="successful" score="0.793">successful</span> with him. He did every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span> best in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="world" newWord="country" score="0.793">country</span>; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>body</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="body" newWord="thing" score="0.757">thing</span> else in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="country" newWord="neighbourhood" score="0.868">neighbourhood</span>. 
<p>One <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span>, soon after their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="arrival" newWord="entrance" score="0.866">entrance</span>, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth: 
<p>"Lizzy, I never gave you an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="account" newWord="opinion" score="0.68">opinion</span> of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="wedding" newWord="welcomed" score="0.784">welcomed</span>, I believe. You were not by, when I told <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="mamma" newWord="ma" score="0.749">ma</span> and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"
<p>"No really,"replied Elizabeth;"I think there cannot be too little said on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span>."
<p>"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement ' s, because Wickham's lodgings were in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>parish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.891" formerWord="parish" newWord="nation" score="0.891">nation</span>. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span> and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>church</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.867" formerWord="church" newWord="wilderness" score="0.867">wilderness</span>. Well, Monday <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span> came, and I was in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fuss</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.774" formerWord="fuss" newWord="careful" score="0.774">careful</span>! I was so afraid, you know, that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span>, all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> I was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dressing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="dressing" newWord="solitary" score="0.846">solitary</span>, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sermon</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.505" formerWord="sermon" newWord="gayer" score="0.505">gayer</span>. However, I did not hear above one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span> in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.765" formerWord="coat" newWord="shropshire" score="0.765">shropshire</span>."
<p>"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span> were horrid unpleasant all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> I was with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>foot</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.855" formerWord="foot" newWord="reaching" score="0.855">reaching</span> out of doors, though I was there a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.738" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="twelvemonth" score="0.738">twelvemonth</span>. Not one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span>, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scheme</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="scheme" newWord="changes" score="0.841">changes</span>, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span>. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.774" formerWord="carriage" newWord="knock" score="0.774">knock</span> came to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="door" newWord="table" score="0.864">table</span>, my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> was called away upon <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="business" newWord="spot" score="0.751">spot</span> to that horrid <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="end" newWord="inn" score="0.675">inn</span> of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> was to give me away; and if we were beyond the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="hour" newWord="half" score="0.792">half</span>, we could not be married all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes ' <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, and then we all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>set</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.671" formerWord="set" newWord="whispering" score="0.671">whispering</span> out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="wedding" newWord="welcomed" score="0.784">welcomed</span> need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."
<p>"Mr. Darcy!"repeated Elizabeth, in utter <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amazement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="amazement" newWord="rising" score="0.845">rising</span>. 
<p>"Oh, yes! - - he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span> about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"
<p>"If it was to be secret,"said Jane,"say not another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span>. You may depend upon my seeking no further."
<p>"Oh! certainly,"said Elizabeth, though <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>burning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.867" formerWord="burning" newWord="heartfelt" score="0.867">heartfelt</span> with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="stronger" score="0.724">stronger</span>;"we will ask you no questions."
<p>"Thank you,"said Lydia,"for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."
<p>On such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>encouragement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.831" formerWord="encouragement" newWord="native" score="0.831">native</span> to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>power</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="power" newWord="hereafter" score="0.688">hereafter</span>, by running away.

<p>"MY DEAR NIECE, 
<p>"I have just received your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.59" formerWord="letter" newWord="first" score="0.59">first</span>, and shall devote this whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span> to answering it, as I foresee that a little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>writing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="writing" newWord="purposely" score="0.791">purposely</span> will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>application</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.831" formerWord="application" newWord="memory" score="0.831">memory</span>; I did not expect it from you. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.677" formerWord="side" newWord="board" score="0.677">board</span>. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impertinence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="impertinence" newWord="injuring" score="0.722">injuring</span>. Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> is as much surprised as I am - - and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>belief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.891" formerWord="belief" newWord="welfare" score="0.891">welfare</span> of your being a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span> concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit. 
<p>"On the very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span> of my coming <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span> from Longbourn, your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> had a most unexpected <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="visitor" newWord="drawn" score="0.789">drawn</span>. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="stronger" score="0.724">stronger</span> was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span> and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span> after ourselves, and came to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.809">bath</span> with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resolution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="resolution" newWord="presence" score="0.845">presence</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hunting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="hunting" newWord="lane" score="0.841">lane</span> for them. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>motive</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="motive" newWord="difficulty" score="0.766">difficulty</span> professed was his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conviction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="conviction" newWord="persuasion" score="0.814">persuasion</span> of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="character" newWord="skin" score="0.704">skin</span> to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="pride" newWord="vanity" score="0.74">vanity</span>, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="world" newWord="country" score="0.793">country</span>. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="character" newWord="skin" score="0.704">skin</span> was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>duty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.805" formerWord="duty" newWord="inconvenience" score="0.805">inconvenience</span> to step forward, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>endeavour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.881" formerWord="endeavour" newWord="try" score="0.881">try</span> to remedy an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evil</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="evil" newWord="necessity" score="0.814">necessity</span> which had been brought on by himself. If he had another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>motive</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="motive" newWord="difficulty" score="0.766">difficulty</span>, I am sure it would never <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disgrace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="disgrace" newWord="inconvenience" score="0.813">inconvenience</span> him. He had been some days in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.809">bath</span>, before he was able to discover them; but he had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> to direct his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>search</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="search" newWord="successful" score="0.827">successful</span>, which was more than we had; and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consciousness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.912" formerWord="consciousness" newWord="sweetness" score="0.912">sweetness</span> of this was another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="reason" newWord="objection" score="0.833">objection</span> for his resolving to follow us. 
<p>"There is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.588" formerWord="lady" newWord="miss" score="0.588">miss</span>, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> ago <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>governess</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="governess" newWord="sinned" score="0.783">sinned</span> to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>charge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="charge" newWord="distaste" score="0.84">distaste</span> on some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.879" formerWord="cause" newWord="division" score="0.879">division</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disapprobation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="disapprobation" newWord="heroine" score="0.784">heroine</span>, though he did not say what. She then took a large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span> in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="complaisance" score="0.829">complaisance</span> of him as soon as he got to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.809">bath</span>. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trust</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.819" formerWord="trust" newWord="chuse" score="0.819">chuse</span>, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span> was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="arrival" newWord="entrance" score="0.866">entrance</span> in London, and had she been able to receive them into her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span>, they would have taken up their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>abode</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.886" formerWord="abode" newWord="excess" score="0.886">excess</span> with her. At <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>length</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.83" formerWord="length" newWord="taunton" score="0.83">taunton</span>, however, our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="kind" newWord="sort" score="0.719">sort</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span> procured the wished-for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>direction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.881" formerWord="direction" newWord="wall" score="0.881">wall</span>. They were in - - - - <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>street</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.837" formerWord="street" newWord="pulteney" score="0.837">pulteney</span>. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.742" formerWord="object" newWord="evil" score="0.742">evil</span> with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="situation" newWord="understanding" score="0.827">understanding</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>return</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.638" formerWord="return" newWord="consent" score="0.638">consent</span> to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assistance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="assistance" newWord="confidant" score="0.859">confidant</span>, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="none" newWord="matches" score="0.753">matches</span> of her friends; she wanted no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>help</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="help" newWord="bear" score="0.769">bear</span> of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="marriage" newWord="anticipation" score="0.749">anticipation</span>, which, in his very first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="conversation" newWord="fronted" score="0.707">fronted</span> with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="design" newWord="scheming" score="0.781">scheming</span>. He confessed himself obliged to leave the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.855" formerWord="regiment" newWord="viscountess" score="0.855">viscountess</span>, on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="account" newWord="opinion" score="0.68">opinion</span> of some debts of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="honour" newWord="authority" score="0.759">authority</span>, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>flight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.798" formerWord="flight" newWord="ancient" score="0.798">ancient</span> on her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>folly</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="folly" newWord="sweetness" score="0.86">sweetness</span> alone. He meant to resign his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>commission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.726" formerWord="commission" newWord="behindhand" score="0.726">behindhand</span> immediately; and as to his future <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="situation" newWord="understanding" score="0.827">understanding</span>, he could <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conjecture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.595" formerWord="conjecture" newWord="dejected" score="0.595">dejected</span> very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> to live on. 
<p>"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span> at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> for him, and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="situation" newWord="understanding" score="0.827">understanding</span> must have been benefited by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="marriage" newWord="anticipation" score="0.749">anticipation</span>. But he found, in reply to this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.764" formerWord="question" newWord="matter" score="0.764">matter</span>, that Wickham still cherished the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hope</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.661" formerWord="hope" newWord="suffice" score="0.661">suffice</span> of more effectually making his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span> by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="marriage" newWord="anticipation" score="0.749">anticipation</span> in some other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="country" newWord="neighbourhood" score="0.868">neighbourhood</span>. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proof</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="proof" newWord="instance" score="0.808">instance</span> against the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temptation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="temptation" newWord="dimensions" score="0.758">dimensions</span> of immediate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.812" formerWord="relief" newWord="force" score="0.812">force</span>. 
<p>"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="course" newWord="lease" score="0.775">lease</span> wanted more than he could get; but at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>length</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.83" formerWord="length" newWord="taunton" score="0.83">taunton</span> was reduced to be reasonable. 
<p>"Every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span> being settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="step" newWord="forbade" score="0.829">forbade</span> was to make your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>street</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.837" formerWord="street" newWord="pulteney" score="0.837">pulteney</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="evening" newWord="whole" score="0.802">whole</span> before I came <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span>. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inquiry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="inquiry" newWord="aid" score="0.794">aid</span>, that your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span> was still with him, but would quit <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.809">bath</span> the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span>. He did not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.755" formerWord="judge" newWord="deserve" score="0.755">deserve</span> your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span> to be a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.739" formerWord="person" newWord="woman" score="0.739">woman</span> whom he could so properly consult as your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span>, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>departure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.939" formerWord="departure" newWord="chief" score="0.939">chief</span> of the former. He did not leave his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="name" newWord="sole" score="0.577">sole</span>, and till the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span> it was only known that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="military" score="0.766">military</span> had called on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="business" newWord="spot" score="0.751">spot</span>. 
<p>"On Saturday he came again. Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span> was gone, your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span>, and, as I said before, they had a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.538" formerWord="deal" newWord="yawn" score="0.538">yawn</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>talk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.81" formerWord="talk" newWord="hear" score="0.81">hear</span> together. 
<p>"They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>express</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="express" newWord="catch" score="0.857">catch</span> was sent off to Longbourn. But our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="visitor" newWord="drawn" score="0.789">drawn</span> was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>obstinacy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.788" formerWord="obstinacy" newWord="females" score="0.788">females</span> is the real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>defect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.604" formerWord="defect" newWord="decree" score="0.604">decree</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="character" newWord="skin" score="0.704">skin</span>, after all.

<p>"They battled it together for a long <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, which was more than either the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="military" score="0.766">military</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.588" formerWord="lady" newWord="miss" score="0.588">miss</span> concerned in it deserved.

<p>"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people.

<p>"It is no such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span>.

<p>"You may depend on it,"replied the other,"for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>night</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="night" newWord="week" score="0.852">week</span>; I saw her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>passing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="passing" newWord="crowded" score="0.847">crowded</span> by, and went out myself on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="purpose" newWord="prepare" score="0.803">prepare</span> to know the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="truth" newWord="case" score="0.799">case</span> of it; and she told me that it was certain true.

<p>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="name" newWord="sole" score="0.577">sole</span> to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said: 
<p>"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span> told us of the present <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>report</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="report" newWord="division" score="0.866">division</span>; and I know I appeared distressed.

I was only confused for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="moment" newWord="morning" score="0.703">morning</span>, because I felt that I should be looked at.

<p>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="view" newWord="aspect" score="0.852">aspect</span> than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>probability</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.874" formerWord="probability" newWord="demands" score="0.874">demands</span> of his coming there with his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>permission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.742" formerWord="permission" newWord="prosperous" score="0.742">prosperous</span>, or being bold enough to come without it. 
<p>"Yet it is hard,"she sometimes thought,"that this poor <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> cannot come to a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span> which he has legally hired, without raising all this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speculation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="speculation" newWord="motherly" score="0.772">motherly</span>!

They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them. 
<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span> which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>twelvemonth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.755" formerWord="twelvemonth" newWord="communicating" score="0.755">communicating</span> ago, was now brought forward again. 
<p>"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,"said Mrs. Bennet,"you will wait on him of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="course" newWord="lease" score="0.775">lease</span>."
<p>"No, no.

<p>His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.789">son</span> represented to him how absolutely necessary such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="attention" newWord="eye" score="0.7">eye</span> would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.

<p>"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.

<p>"Could I expect it to be otherwise!"said she."Yet why did he come?"

<p>She inquired after his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>, but could do no more.

<p>He readily agreed to it. 
<p>"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.

Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ' Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet, ' without there being a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>syllable</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.785" formerWord="syllable" newWord="deliberately" score="0.785">deliberately</span> said of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>, or the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.653">house</span> where she lived, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span>.

<p>Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell. 
<p>"It is a delightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span>, to be sure, to have a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="daughter" newWord="son" score="0.842">son</span> well married,"continued her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>,"but at the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span> from me.

Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."
<p>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>misery</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="misery" newWord="dread" score="0.902">dread</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shame</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="shame" newWord="observations" score="0.843">observations</span>, that she could hardly keep her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>seat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="seat" newWord="neck" score="0.828">neck</span>.

<p>As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interruption</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="interruption" newWord="gallery" score="0.827">gallery</span> on those subjects that must deaden them more.

<p>She was in hopes that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="evening" newWord="whole" score="0.802">whole</span> would afford some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="quarter" score="0.807">quarter</span> of bringing them together; that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="whole" newWord="party" score="0.827">party</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="visit" newWord="longbourn" score="0.678">longbourn</span> would not pass away without enabling them to enter into <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> more of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="conversation" newWord="fronted" score="0.707">fronted</span> than the mere ceremonious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>salutation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="salutation" newWord="abundantly" score="0.724">abundantly</span> attending his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>entrance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="entrance" newWord="departure" score="0.938">departure</span>.

<p>"If he does not come to me, then,"said she,"I shall give him up for ever."
<p>The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="round" newWord="table" score="0.799">table</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="table" newWord="door" score="0.864">door</span>, where Miss Bennet was making <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="tea" newWord="breakfast" score="0.869">breakfast</span>, and Elizabeth pouring out the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coffee</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="coffee" newWord="shoulder" score="0.773">shoulder</span>, in so close a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confederacy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.69" formerWord="confederacy" newWord="alas" score="0.69">alas</span> that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.873" formerWord="chair" newWord="neck" score="0.873">neck</span>. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whisper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.571" formerWord="whisper" newWord="hurry" score="0.571">hurry</span>:

<p>Darcy had walked away to another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="part" newWord="mode" score="0.722">mode</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span>.

<p>She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coffee</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="coffee" newWord="shoulder" score="0.773">shoulder</span> cup himself; and she seized the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="quarter" score="0.807">quarter</span> of saying: 
<p>"Is your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span> at Pemberley still?"
<p>"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."
<p>"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"
<p>"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."
<p>She could think of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="success" newWord="timidity" score="0.847">timidity</span>.

<p>When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>'s rapacity for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whist</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="whist" newWord="immovable" score="0.802">immovable</span> players, and in a few moments after seated with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="rest" newWord="field" score="0.794">field</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span>.

<p>Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>supper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="supper" newWord="reaching" score="0.902">reaching</span>; but their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.774" formerWord="carriage" newWord="knock" score="0.774">knock</span> was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="quarter" score="0.807">quarter</span> of detaining them. 
<p>"Well girls,"said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,"What say you to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>?

And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="beauty" newWord="youth" score="0.858">youth</span>. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? ' Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last. ' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>creature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="creature" newWord="fellow" score="0.775">fellow</span> as ever lived - - and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."
<p>Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="addresses" score="0.802">addresses</span> to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.771" formerWord="advantage" newWord="necessity" score="0.771">necessity</span> to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span>, when in a happy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="humour" newWord="humoured" score="0.868">humoured</span>, were so far beyond <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="reason" newWord="objection" score="0.833">objection</span>, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>, to make his proposals. 
<p>"It has been a very agreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>,"said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth."The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span> seemed so well selected, so suitable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> with the other. I hope we may often meet again."
<p>Elizabeth smiled. 
<p>"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.

<p>"You are very cruel,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>,"you will not let me <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.581" formerWord="smile" newWord="listening" score="0.581">listening</span>, and are provoking me to it every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="moment" newWord="morning" score="0.703">morning</span>."
<p>"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"
<p>"And how impossible in others!"
<p>"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"
<p>"That is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.764" formerWord="question" newWord="matter" score="0.764">matter</span> which I hardly know how to answer.

<p>A few days after this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="visit" newWord="longbourn" score="0.678">longbourn</span>, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.

<p>"Next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> you call,"said she,"I hope we shall be more lucky."
<p>He should be particularly happy at any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="quarter" score="0.807">quarter</span> of waiting on them.
