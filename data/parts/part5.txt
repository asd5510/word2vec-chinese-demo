It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.

The Netherfield ladies would have had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>difficulty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="difficulty" newWord="motive" score="0.766">motive</span> in believing that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> who lived by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trade</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.855" formerWord="trade" newWord="pork" score="0.855">pork</span>, and within <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="view" newWord="aspect" score="0.852">aspect</span> of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span>, and a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>favourite</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="favourite" newWord="sweetest" score="0.747">sweetest</span> with all her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Longbourn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="Longbourn" newWord="rosings" score="0.89">Rosings</span> nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.717" formerWord="regard" newWord="partner" score="0.717">partner</span>. They had frequently been staying with her in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.809">bath</span>. 
<p>The first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="part" newWord="mode" score="0.722">mode</span> of Mrs. Gardiner's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="business" newWord="spot" score="0.751">spot</span> on her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="arrival" newWord="entrance" score="0.866">entrance</span> was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="part" newWord="mode" score="0.722">mode</span> to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>. Two of her girls had been upon the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="point" newWord="subject" score="0.73">subject</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="marriage" newWord="anticipation" score="0.749">anticipation</span>, and after all there was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> in it. 
<p>"I do not blame Jane,"she continued,"for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.789">son</span> by this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, had it not been for her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>perverseness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="perverseness" newWord="walls" score="0.893">walls</span>.

The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consequence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="consequence" newWord="instance" score="0.839">instance</span> of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="daughter" newWord="son" score="0.842">son</span> married before I have, and that the Longbourn <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>estate</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.8" formerWord="estate" newWord="needful" score="0.8">needful</span> is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span>, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="anybody" newWord="myself" score="0.828">myself</span> else. However, your coming just at this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."
<p>Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="chief" newWord="owner" score="0.943">owner</span> of this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>news</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="news" newWord="coachman" score="0.776">coachman</span> had been given before, in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="course" newWord="lease" score="0.775">lease</span> of Jane and Elizabeth's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>correspondence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="correspondence" newWord="consoled" score="0.797">consoled</span> with her, made her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span> a slight <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.643" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.643">apology</span>, and, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.798" formerWord="compassion" newWord="health" score="0.798">health</span> to her nieces, turned the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="conversation" newWord="fronted" score="0.707">fronted</span>. 
<p>When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span>."It seems likely to have been a desirable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.691" formerWord="match" newWord="granted" score="0.691">granted</span> for Jane,"said she."I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span>, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.53" formerWord="love" newWord="wise" score="0.53">wise</span> with a pretty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="girl" newWord="natured" score="0.843">natured</span> for a few weeks, and when <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accident</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="accident" newWord="solicited" score="0.751">solicited</span> separates them, so easily forgets her, that these <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.732" formerWord="sort" newWord="doer" score="0.732">doer</span> of inconsistencies are very frequent."

We do not suffer by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accident</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="accident" newWord="solicited" score="0.751">solicited</span>. It does not often happen that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.838" formerWord="interference" newWord="curacy" score="0.838">curacy</span> of friends will persuade a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> of independent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span> to think no more of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="girl" newWord="natured" score="0.843">natured</span> whom he was violently in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.53" formerWord="love" newWord="wise" score="0.53">wise</span> with only a few days before."
<p>"But that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>expression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.855" formerWord="expression" newWord="air" score="0.855">air</span> of ' violently in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.53" formerWord="love" newWord="wise" score="0.53">wise</span> ' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.701" formerWord="idea" newWord="consequence" score="0.701">consequence</span>.

Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley's love?"
<p>"I never saw a more promising <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inclination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.767" formerWord="inclination" newWord="alarm" score="0.767">alarm</span>; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> they met, it was more decided and remarkable.

It had better have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scene</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.895" formerWord="scene" newWord="bowling" score="0.895">bowling</span> might be of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>service</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.746" formerWord="service" newWord="heat" score="0.746">heat</span> - - and perhaps a little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.812" formerWord="relief" newWord="force" score="0.812">force</span> from <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span> may be as useful as <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span>."
<p>Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proposal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="proposal" newWord="unconscious" score="0.866">unconscious</span>, and felt persuaded of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>'s ready <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquiescence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.815" formerWord="acquiescence" newWord="describing" score="0.815">describing</span>. 
<p>"I hope,"added Mrs. Gardiner,"that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="consideration" newWord="succeeding" score="0.663">succeeding</span> with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.717" formerWord="regard" newWord="partner" score="0.717">partner</span> to this young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> will influence her.

<p>"And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span>, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="part" newWord="mode" score="0.722">mode</span> of London! My dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span>, how could you think of it?

<p>"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>? She will not be able to help calling."
<p>"She will drop the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquaintance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.633" formerWord="acquaintance" newWord="neighbours" score="0.633">neighbours</span> entirely."

<p>"You are too sensible a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="girl" newWord="natured" score="0.843">natured</span>, Lizzy, to fall in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.53" formerWord="love" newWord="wise" score="0.53">wise</span> merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.635" formerWord="speaking" newWord="lieutenant" score="0.635">lieutenant</span> openly.

I have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> to say against him; he is a most interesting young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span>; and if he had the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span> he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.

Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span> would depend on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resolution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="resolution" newWord="presence" score="0.845">presence</span> and good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conduct</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="conduct" newWord="opinion" score="0.793">opinion</span>, I am sure. You must not disappoint your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>."
<p>"My dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span>, this is being serious indeed."
<p>"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."
<p>"Well, then, you need not be under any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>alarm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.768" formerWord="alarm" newWord="resentment" score="0.768">resentment</span>.

<p>"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."
<p>"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.53" formerWord="love" newWord="wise" score="0.53">wise</span> with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.

My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span>, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span> that where there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="affection" newWord="partiality" score="0.759">partiality</span>, young people are seldom withheld by immediate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="want" newWord="use" score="0.707">use</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span> from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wisdom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="wisdom" newWord="loving" score="0.676">loving</span> to resist?

In short, I will do my best."
<p>"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span> of inviting him."
<p>"As I did the other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>,"said Elizabeth with a conscious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.581" formerWord="smile" newWord="listening" score="0.581">listening</span>:"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that.

<p>Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span> assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kindness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="kindness" newWord="health" score="0.839">health</span> of her hints, they parted; a wonderful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>instance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="instance" newWord="necessity" score="0.851">necessity</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="advice" newWord="intentions" score="0.86">intentions</span> being given on such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="point" newWord="subject" score="0.73">subject</span>, without being resented.

<p>"If you will only tell me what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.732" formerWord="sort" newWord="doer" score="0.732">doer</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="girl" newWord="natured" score="0.843">natured</span> Miss King is, I shall know what to think."
<p>"She is a very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="kind" newWord="sort" score="0.719">sort</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="girl" newWord="natured" score="0.843">natured</span>, I believe.

<p>"But he paid her not the smallest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="attention" newWord="eye" score="0.7">eye</span> till her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>grandfather</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="grandfather" newWord="disrespect" score="0.675">disrespect</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>death</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="death" newWord="longest" score="0.793">longest</span> made her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mistress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.826" formerWord="mistress" newWord="assurances" score="0.826">assurances</span> of this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span>."
<p>"No - - why should he?

<p>"Well,"cried Elizabeth,"have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish."
<p>"No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose.
