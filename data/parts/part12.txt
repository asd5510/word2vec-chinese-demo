<p>Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span>; so easily guided that his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>worth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.744" formerWord="worth" newWord="novel" score="0.744">novel</span> was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.76" formerWord="happiness" newWord="conduct" score="0.76">conduct</span> of Bingley, which of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="course" newWord="lease" score="0.775">lease</span> was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="conversation" newWord="fronted" score="0.707">fronted</span> till they reached the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span>. In the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hall</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.812" formerWord="hall" newWord="lodge" score="0.812">lodge</span> they parted.

<p>"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.764" formerWord="question" newWord="matter" score="0.764">matter</span> which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span>, and from all the others when they sat down to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="table" newWord="door" score="0.864">door</span>. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>knowledge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="knowledge" newWord="delicacy" score="0.808">delicacy</span>. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span> else, awakened a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>suspicion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="suspicion" newWord="article" score="0.795">article</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="truth" newWord="case" score="0.799">case</span>. 
<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="evening" newWord="whole" score="0.802">whole</span> passed quietly, unmarked by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span> extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disposition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="disposition" newWord="health" score="0.794">health</span> in which <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.76" formerWord="happiness" newWord="conduct" score="0.76">conduct</span> overflows in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mirth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="mirth" newWord="oaks" score="0.843">oaks</span>; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>embarrassment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="embarrassment" newWord="activity" score="0.89">activity</span>, there were other evils before her.

<p>At <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>night</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="night" newWord="week" score="0.852">week</span> she opened her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.752" formerWord="heart" newWord="sister" score="0.752">sister</span> to Jane. Though <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>suspicion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="suspicion" newWord="article" score="0.795">article</span> was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here. 
<p>"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! - - engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."
<p>"This is a wretched <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beginning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.739" formerWord="beginning" newWord="announced" score="0.739">announced</span> indeed! My sole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dependence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="dependence" newWord="vicinity" score="0.846">vicinity</span> was on you; and I am sure <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nobody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="nobody" newWord="somebody" score="0.743">somebody</span> else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>earnest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="earnest" newWord="successfully" score="0.839">successfully</span>.

He still loves me, and we are engaged."
<p>Jane looked at her doubtingly."Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him."
<p>"You know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="matter" newWord="case" score="0.781">case</span>. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>memory</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="memory" newWord="welfare" score="0.833">welfare</span> is unpardonable. This is the last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> I shall ever remember it myself."
<p>Miss Bennet still looked all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amazement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="amazement" newWord="rising" score="0.845">rising</span>. Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="truth" newWord="case" score="0.799">case</span>. 
<p>"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,"cried Jane."My dear, dear Lizzy, I would - - I do congratulate you - - but are you certain? forgive the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.764" formerWord="question" newWord="matter" score="0.764">matter</span> - - are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"
<p>"There can be no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="doubt" newWord="harm" score="0.813">harm</span> of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>couple</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.812" formerWord="couple" newWord="exploring" score="0.812">exploring</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="world" newWord="country" score="0.793">country</span>. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="brother" newWord="mother" score="0.851">mother</span>?"
<p>"Very, very much. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">Anything</span> could give either Bingley or myself more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="delight" newWord="sweets" score="0.854">sweets</span>. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span> rather than marry without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="affection" newWord="partiality" score="0.759">partiality</span>. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"
<p>"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all."
<p>"What do you mean?"
<p>"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry."
<p>"My dearest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>, now be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span> that I am to know, without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delay</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.826" formerWord="delay" newWord="article" score="0.826">article</span>. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"
<p>"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>date</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="date" newWord="earliest" score="0.806">earliest</span> it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."
<p>Another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>entreaty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.774" formerWord="entreaty" newWord="ravenshaw" score="0.774">ravenshaw</span> that she would be serious, however, produced the desired <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>effect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="effect" newWord="examination" score="0.814">examination</span>; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="attachment" newWord="affection" score="0.743">affection</span>. When convinced on that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>article</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.826" formerWord="article" newWord="delay" score="0.826">delay</span>, Miss Bennet had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> further to wish. 
<p>"Now I am quite happy,"said she,"for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>value</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="value" newWord="proposal" score="0.852">proposal</span> for him. Were it for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> but his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.53" formerWord="love" newWord="wise" score="0.53">wise</span> of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span> and your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>husband</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.892" formerWord="husband" newWord="nerves" score="0.892">nerves</span>, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you."
<p>Elizabeth told her the motives of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>secrecy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="secrecy" newWord="principle" score="0.781">principle</span>.

I had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.729" formerWord="notion" newWord="aware" score="0.729">aware</span> but he would go a-shooting, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> or other, and not disturb us with his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>company</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.633" formerWord="company" newWord="excusable" score="0.633">excusable</span>. What shall we do with him?

<p>Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proposal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="proposal" newWord="unconscious" score="0.866">unconscious</span>; yet was really vexed that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span> should be always giving him such an epithet. 
<p>As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>warmth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.877" formerWord="warmth" newWord="enjoyment" score="0.877">enjoyment</span>, as left no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="doubt" newWord="harm" score="0.813">harm</span> of his good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>information</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="information" newWord="superiority" score="0.783">superiority</span>; and he soon afterwards said aloud,"Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span> again to-day?"
<p>"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,"said Mrs. Bennet,"to walk to Oakham Mount this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span>.

<p>"It may do very well for the others,"replied Mr. Bingley;"but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?"Kitty owned that she had rather stay at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span>.

As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying: 
<p>"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> all to yourself.

<p>During their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>walk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.695" formerWord="walk" newWord="withdrew" score="0.695">withdrew</span>, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.741" formerWord="consent" newWord="furnish" score="0.741">furnish</span> should be asked in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="course" newWord="lease" score="0.775">lease</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="evening" newWord="whole" score="0.802">whole</span>.

She could not determine how her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span> would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wealth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.881" formerWord="wealth" newWord="condemnation" score="0.881">condemnation</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>grandeur</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="grandeur" newWord="furniture" score="0.924">furniture</span> would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span>. But whether she were violently set against the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.691" formerWord="match" newWord="granted" score="0.691">granted</span>, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="manner" newWord="archness" score="0.672">archness</span> would be equally ill adapted to do <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>credit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="credit" newWord="acknowledgment" score="0.808">acknowledgment</span> to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="sense" newWord="breeding" score="0.758">breeding</span>; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>joy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.824" formerWord="joy" newWord="principles" score="0.824">principles</span>, than the first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>vehemence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.557" formerWord="vehemence" newWord="tree" score="0.557">tree</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disapprobation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="disapprobation" newWord="heroine" score="0.784">heroine</span>.
