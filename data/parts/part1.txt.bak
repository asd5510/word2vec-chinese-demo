<p>However little known the feelings or views of such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> may be on his first entering a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span>, this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="truth" newWord="case" score="0.799">case</span> is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>property</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.838" formerWord="property" newWord="suddenness" score="0.838">suddenness</span> of some one or other of their daughters. 
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet,"said his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.588" formerWord="lady" newWord="miss" score="0.588">miss</span> to him <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>,"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
<p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. 
<p>"But it is,"returned she;"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
<p>Mr. Bennet made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.643" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.643">apology</span>.

<p>"You want to tell me, and I have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>objection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="objection" newWord="reason" score="0.833">reason</span> to hearing it."
<p>This was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="invitation" newWord="representing" score="0.777">representing</span> enough. 
<p>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> of large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span> from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>north</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="north" newWord="unusually" score="0.937">unusually</span> of England; that he came down on Monday in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chaise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.886" formerWord="chaise" newWord="coach" score="0.886">coach</span> and four to see the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.653">house</span>, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>possession</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="possession" newWord="defiance" score="0.851">defiance</span> before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span> by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="end" newWord="inn" score="0.675">inn</span> of next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="week" newWord="night" score="0.852">night</span>."

<p>"Bingley."
<p>"Is he married or single?"
<p>"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> of large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span>; four or five thousand a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="year" newWord="week" score="0.841">week</span>. What a fine <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span> for our girls!"
<p>"How so? How can it affect them?"
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet,"replied his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.789">son</span>,"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
<p>"Is that his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="design" newWord="scheming" score="0.781">scheming</span> in settling here?"
<p>"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="Design" newWord="scheming" score="0.781">Scheming</span>! <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nonsense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.748" formerWord="Nonsense" newWord="reads" score="0.748">Reads</span>, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.53" formerWord="love" newWord="wise" score="0.53">wise</span> with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
<p>"I see no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="occasion" newWord="subject" score="0.703">subject</span> for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span>."
<p>"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>share</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="share" newWord="assurance" score="0.793">assurance</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="beauty" newWord="youth" score="0.858">youth</span>, but I do not pretend to be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span> extraordinary now. When a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span> has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thinking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.734" formerWord="thinking" newWord="aware" score="0.734">aware</span> of her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="beauty" newWord="youth" score="0.858">youth</span>."
<p>"In such cases, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span> has not often much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="beauty" newWord="youth" score="0.858">youth</span> to think of."
<p>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span>."
<p>"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
<p>"But consider your daughters. Only think what an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>establishment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.763" formerWord="establishment" newWord="unnatural" score="0.763">unnatural</span> it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="account" newWord="opinion" score="0.68">opinion</span>, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not."
<p>"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.741" formerWord="consent" newWord="furnish" score="0.741">furnish</span> to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span> for my little Lizzy."
<p>"I <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.741" formerWord="desire" newWord="dispose" score="0.741">dispose</span> you will do no such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span>. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="half" newWord="hour" score="0.792">hour</span> so handsome as Jane, nor <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="half" newWord="hour" score="0.792">hour</span> so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>preference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.885" formerWord="preference" newWord="errors" score="0.885">errors</span>."
<p>"They have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="none" newWord="matches" score="0.753">matches</span> of them much to recommend them,"replied he;"they are all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silly</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.863" formerWord="silly" newWord="clever" score="0.863">clever</span> and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> more of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quickness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.865" formerWord="quickness" newWord="falling" score="0.865">falling</span> than her sisters."
<p>"Mr. Bennet, how can you <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>abuse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.634" formerWord="abuse" newWord="estimating" score="0.634">estimating</span> your own children in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span>? You take <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="delight" newWord="sweets" score="0.854">sweets</span> in vexing me. You have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.798" formerWord="compassion" newWord="health" score="0.798">health</span> for my poor nerves."
<p>"You <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mistake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="mistake" newWord="pity" score="0.827">pity</span> me, my dear. I have a high <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>respect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.692" formerWord="respect" newWord="music" score="0.692">music</span> for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="consideration" newWord="succeeding" score="0.663">succeeding</span> these last twenty years at least."
<p>"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
<p>"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="year" newWord="week" score="0.841">week</span> come into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span>."
<p>"It will be no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>use</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.786" formerWord="use" newWord="fear" score="0.786">fear</span> to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
<p>"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."
<p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mixture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.878" formerWord="mixture" newWord="defiance" score="0.878">defiance</span> of quick parts, sarcastic <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="humour" newWord="humoured" score="0.868">humoured</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.871" formerWord="reserve" newWord="medium" score="0.871">medium</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>caprice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.871" formerWord="caprice" newWord="horror" score="0.871">horror</span>, that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>experience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="experience" newWord="lover" score="0.804">lover</span> of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.789">son</span> understand his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="character" newWord="skin" score="0.704">skin</span>.

<p>Chapter 2 
<p>
<p>Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.789">son</span> that he should not go; and till the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="evening" newWord="whole" score="0.802">whole</span> after the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="visit" newWord="longbourn" score="0.678">longbourn</span> was paid she had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>knowledge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="knowledge" newWord="delicacy" score="0.808">delicacy</span> of it. It was then disclosed in the following <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="manner" newWord="archness" score="0.672">archness</span>. Observing his second <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="daughter" newWord="son" score="0.842">son</span> employed in trimming a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.742" formerWord="hat" newWord="pocket" score="0.742">pocket</span>, he suddenly addressed her with: 
<p>"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."
<p>"We are not in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span> to know what Mr. Bingley likes,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span> resentfully,"since we are not to visit."
<p>"But you forget, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="mamma" newWord="ma" score="0.749">ma</span>,"said Elizabeth,"that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."
<p>"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span>. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span>, and I have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="opinion" newWord="conduct" score="0.793">conduct</span> of her."
<p>"No more have I,"said Mr. Bennet;"and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."
<p>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters. 
<p>"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="sake" newWord="amends" score="0.751">amends</span>!

<p>"Aye, so it is,"cried her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>,"and Mrs. Long does not come back till the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span> before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."
<p>"Then, my dear, you may have the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.771" formerWord="advantage" newWord="necessity" score="0.771">necessity</span> of your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span>, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her."
<p>"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?"

<p>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="part" newWord="mode" score="0.722">mode</span> of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="conversation" newWord="fronted" score="0.707">fronted</span> between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="dance" newWord="dine" score="0.792">dine</span> for a few minutes, to press his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span> to join it.

<p>"I certainly shall not.

<p>Mr. Bingley followed his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="advice" newWord="intentions" score="0.86">intentions</span>.

<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="evening" newWord="whole" score="0.802">whole</span> altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span>.

So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> of your set-downs.

<p>"He is just what a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> ought to be,"said she,"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sensible</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.717" formerWord="sensible" newWord="amiable" score="0.717">amiable</span>, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! - - so much ease, with such perfect good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breeding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="breeding" newWord="benevolent" score="0.823">benevolent</span>!"

<p>"Dear Lizzy!"

<p>"Certainly not - - at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.

<p>"But she does help him on, as much as her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="nature" newWord="degree" score="0.743">degree</span> will allow.

<p>"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="moment" newWord="morning" score="0.703">morning</span> should be employed in conversing together.
