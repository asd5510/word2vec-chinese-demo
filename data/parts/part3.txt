<p>Mr. Darcy took her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="advice" newWord="intentions" score="0.86">intentions</span>, and did finish his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.59" formerWord="letter" newWord="first" score="0.59">first</span>. 
<p>When that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="business" newWord="spot" score="0.751">spot</span> was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indulgence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="indulgence" newWord="affectation" score="0.773">affectation</span> of some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>music</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="music" newWord="humanity" score="0.799">humanity</span>.

<p>Mrs. Hurst sang with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>instrument</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="instrument" newWord="campbells" score="0.916">campbells</span>, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her.

<p>When <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="tea" newWord="breakfast" score="0.869">breakfast</span> was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table - - but in vain.

She assured him that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> intended to play, and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.736" formerWord="silence" newWord="rising" score="0.736">rising</span> of the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span> seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="book" newWord="pocket" score="0.842">pocket</span>; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="brother" newWord="mother" score="0.851">mother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="conversation" newWord="fronted" score="0.707">fronted</span> with Miss Bennet. 
<p>Miss Bingley's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="attention" newWord="eye" score="0.7">eye</span> was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>progress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.925" formerWord="progress" newWord="purity" score="0.925">purity</span> through his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="book" newWord="pocket" score="0.842">pocket</span>, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inquiry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="inquiry" newWord="aid" score="0.794">aid</span>, or looking at his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>page</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.871" formerWord="page" newWord="theatrical" score="0.871">theatrical</span>.

<p>No <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="book" newWord="pocket" score="0.842">pocket</span>, and cast her eyes round the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span> in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.9" formerWord="quest" newWord="defiance" score="0.9">defiance</span> for some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amusement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.811" formerWord="amusement" newWord="profit" score="0.811">profit</span>; when hearing her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="brother" newWord="mother" score="0.851">mother</span> mentioning a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.713" formerWord="ball" newWord="butler" score="0.713">butler</span> to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:

<p>"If you mean Darcy,"cried her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="brother" newWord="mother" score="0.851">mother</span>,"he may go to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>bed</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.838" formerWord="bed" newWord="revive" score="0.838">revive</span>, if he chooses, before it begins - - but as for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.713" formerWord="ball" newWord="butler" score="0.713">butler</span>, it is quite a settled <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span>; and as soon as Nicholls has made white <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>soup</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.76" formerWord="soup" newWord="discernment" score="0.76">discernment</span> enough, I shall send <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="round" newWord="table" score="0.799">table</span> my cards."
<p>"I should like balls infinitely better,"she replied,"if they were carried on in a different <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="manner" newWord="archness" score="0.672">archness</span>; but there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> insufferably tedious in the usual <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>process</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.848" formerWord="process" newWord="dimensions" score="0.848">dimensions</span> of such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meeting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="meeting" newWord="remaining" score="0.757">remaining</span>.

<p>Miss Bingley made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.643" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.643">apology</span>, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span>. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>figure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.863" formerWord="figure" newWord="tender" score="0.863">tender</span> was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.

<p>Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.

<p>"Not at all,"was her answer;"but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span> of disappointing him will be to ask <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> about it."
<p>Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span>, and persevered therefore in requiring an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>explanation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="explanation" newWord="perusal" score="0.839">perusal</span> of his two motives.

<p>By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>guest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="guest" newWord="complacency" score="0.911">complacency</span> into the drawing-room again, and, when <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="tea" newWord="breakfast" score="0.869">breakfast</span> was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.

<p>Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>backgammon</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.77" formerWord="backgammon" newWord="biscuits" score="0.77">biscuits</span>. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
