<p>"And I wish my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>collection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="collection" newWord="total" score="0.86">total</span> were larger for your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>benefit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.862" formerWord="benefit" newWord="gowns" score="0.862">gowns</span> and my own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>credit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="credit" newWord="acknowledgment" score="0.808">acknowledgment</span>; but I am an idle <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fellow</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="fellow" newWord="clever" score="0.796">clever</span>, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into."
<p>Elizabeth assured him that she could <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>suit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.755" formerWord="suit" newWord="frighten" score="0.755">frighten</span> herself perfectly with those in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span>. 
<p>"I am astonished,"said Miss Bingley,"that my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span> should have left so small a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>collection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="collection" newWord="total" score="0.86">total</span> of books. What a delightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>library</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="library" newWord="opposite" score="0.804">opposite</span> you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"
<p>"It ought to be good,"he replied,"it has been the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>work</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.713" formerWord="work" newWord="betsey" score="0.713">betsey</span> of many generations."
<p>"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books."
<p>"I cannot comprehend the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neglect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="neglect" newWord="convenience" score="0.813">convenience</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>library</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="library" newWord="opposite" score="0.804">opposite</span> in such days as these."
<p>"Neglect! I am sure you <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neglect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="neglect" newWord="convenience" score="0.813">convenience</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> that can add to the beauties of that noble <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.653">house</span>. Charles, when you build your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span>, I wish it may be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="half" newWord="hour" score="0.792">hour</span> as delightful as Pemberley."
<p>"I wish it may."
<p>"But I would really advise you to make your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purchase</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.695" formerWord="purchase" newWord="writer" score="0.695">writer</span> in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span>, and take Pemberley for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="kind" newWord="sort" score="0.719">sort</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>model</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="model" newWord="matrimony" score="0.803">matrimony</span>.

<p>"With all my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.752" formerWord="heart" newWord="sister" score="0.752">sister</span>; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."
<p>"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."
<p>"Upon my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span>, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purchase</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.695" formerWord="purchase" newWord="writer" score="0.695">writer</span> than by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>imitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="imitation" newWord="series" score="0.776">series</span>."
<p>Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="attention" newWord="eye" score="0.7">eye</span> for her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="book" newWord="pocket" score="0.842">pocket</span>; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>, to observe the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>game</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.877" formerWord="game" newWord="latter" score="0.877">latter</span>. 
<p>"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>spring</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.836" formerWord="spring" newWord="kitchen" score="0.836">kitchen</span>?"said Miss Bingley;"will she be as tall as I am?"
<p>"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>height</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.886" formerWord="height" newWord="tender" score="0.886">tender</span>, or rather taller."
<p>"How I long to see her again! I never met with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="anybody" newWord="myself" score="0.828">myself</span> who delighted me so much. Such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>countenance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="countenance" newWord="affectionate" score="0.762">affectionate</span>, such manners!

<p>"It is amazing to me,"said Bingley,"how young ladies can have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>patience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="patience" newWord="selfish" score="0.777">selfish</span> to be so very accomplished as they all are."
<p>"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"
<p>"Yes, all of them, I think. They all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>paint</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.652" formerWord="paint" newWord="brute" score="0.652">brute</span> tables, cover screens, and net purses.

<p>"Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>list</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="list" newWord="reconciliation" score="0.875">reconciliation</span> of the common <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>extent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.891" formerWord="extent" newWord="grounds" score="0.891">grounds</span> of accomplishments,"said Darcy,"has too much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="truth" newWord="case" score="0.799">case</span>. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span> is applied to many a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span> who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.682" formerWord="purse" newWord="emotions" score="0.682">emotions</span> or covering a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>screen</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="screen" newWord="strengthen" score="0.74">strengthen</span>.

<p>"Nor I, I am sure,"said Miss Bingley. 
<p>"Then,"observed Elizabeth,"you must comprehend a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.538" formerWord="deal" newWord="yawn" score="0.538">yawn</span> in your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.701" formerWord="idea" newWord="consequence" score="0.701">consequence</span> of an accomplished <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span>."
<p>"Yes, I do comprehend a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.538" formerWord="deal" newWord="yawn" score="0.538">yawn</span> in it."
<p>"Oh! certainly,"cried his faithful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assistant</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.659" formerWord="assistant" newWord="hurry" score="0.659">hurry</span>,"no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.

<p>"All this she must possess,"added Darcy,"and to all this she must yet add <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> more substantial, in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>improvement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.884" formerWord="improvement" newWord="fixing" score="0.884">fixing</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.661" formerWord="mind" newWord="feelings" score="0.661">feelings</span> by extensive <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reading</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.64" formerWord="reading" newWord="vanity" score="0.64">vanity</span>."
<p>"I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any."
<p>"Are you so severe upon your own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sex</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="sex" newWord="steward" score="0.804">steward</span> as to doubt the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>possibility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="possibility" newWord="necessity" score="0.935">necessity</span> of all this?"

<p>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>injustice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="injustice" newWord="flow" score="0.842">flow</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>her</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="her" newWord="his" score="0.799">his</span> implied <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="doubt" newWord="harm" score="0.813">harm</span>, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>description</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="description" newWord="impropriety" score="0.802">impropriety</span>, when Mr. Hurst called them to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>order</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="order" newWord="form" score="0.828">form</span>, with bitter complaints of their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inattention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.873" formerWord="inattention" newWord="desirableness" score="0.873">desirableness</span> to what was going forward.

<p>"Elizabeth Bennet,"said Miss Bingley, when the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="door" newWord="table" score="0.864">table</span> was closed on her,"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sex</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="sex" newWord="steward" score="0.804">steward</span> by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="opinion" newWord="conduct" score="0.793">conduct</span>, it is a paltry <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>device</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="device" newWord="riddle" score="0.778">riddle</span>, a very mean art."
<p>"Undoubtedly,"replied Darcy, to whom this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>remark</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.755" formerWord="remark" newWord="personal" score="0.755">personal</span> was chiefly addressed,"there is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meanness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.744" formerWord="meanness" newWord="cases" score="0.744">cases</span> in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."
<p>Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span>. 
<p>Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span> was worse, and that she could not leave her.

In <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>spite</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="spite" newWord="defiance" score="0.889">defiance</span> of this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amendment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.871" formerWord="amendment" newWord="guest" score="0.871">guest</span>, however, she requested to have a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>note</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.706" formerWord="note" newWord="destroyed" score="0.706">destroyed</span> sent to Longbourn, desiring her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span> to visit Jane, and form her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judgement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.844" formerWord="judgement" newWord="curacy" score="0.844">curacy</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="situation" newWord="understanding" score="0.827">understanding</span>. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>note</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.706" formerWord="note" newWord="destroyed" score="0.706">destroyed</span> was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breakfast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="breakfast" newWord="tea" score="0.869">tea</span>.

She would not listen, therefore, to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="daughter" newWord="son" score="0.842">son</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proposal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="proposal" newWord="unconscious" score="0.866">unconscious</span> of being carried <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span>; neither did the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>apothecary</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="apothecary" newWord="latter" score="0.823">latter</span>, who arrived about the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>appearance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.863" formerWord="appearance" newWord="disposal" score="0.863">disposal</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="invitation" newWord="representing" score="0.777">representing</span>, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span> and three daughters all attended her into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breakfast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="breakfast" newWord="tea" score="0.869">tea</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>parlour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.881" formerWord="parlour" newWord="dining" score="0.881">dining</span>. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected. 
<p>"Indeed I have, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.655" formerWord="sir" newWord="bowing" score="0.655">bowing</span>,"was her answer."She is a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.538" formerWord="deal" newWord="yawn" score="0.538">yawn</span> too ill to be moved.

<p>"Removed!"cried Bingley."It must not be thought of. My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>, I am sure, will not hear of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>removal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.872" formerWord="removal" newWord="progress" score="0.872">progress</span>."
<p>"You may depend upon it, Madam,"said Miss Bingley, with cold <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>civility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="civility" newWord="insignificance" score="0.803">insignificance</span>,"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="attention" newWord="eye" score="0.7">eye</span> while she remains with us."
<p>Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. 
<p>"I am sure,"she added,"if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.538" formerWord="deal" newWord="yawn" score="0.538">yawn</span>, though with the greatest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>patience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="patience" newWord="selfish" score="0.777">selfish</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="world" newWord="country" score="0.793">country</span>, which is always the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span> with her, for she has, without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>exception</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="exception" newWord="finest" score="0.868">finest</span>, the sweetest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="temper" newWord="taste" score="0.781">taste</span> I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> to her. You have a sweet <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span> here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>prospect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="prospect" newWord="midst" score="0.927">midst</span> over the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gravel</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.824" formerWord="gravel" newWord="road" score="0.824">road</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>walk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.695" formerWord="walk" newWord="withdrew" score="0.695">withdrew</span>. I do not know a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.653">house</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="country" newWord="neighbourhood" score="0.868">neighbourhood</span> that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hurry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.708" formerWord="hurry" newWord="hungry" score="0.708">hungry</span>, I hope, though you have but a short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lease</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="lease" newWord="course" score="0.775">course</span>."
<p>"Whatever I do is done in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hurry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.708" formerWord="hurry" newWord="hungry" score="0.708">hungry</span>,"replied he;"and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."
<p>"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,"said Elizabeth. 
<p>"You begin to comprehend me, do you?"cried he, turning towards her. 
<p>"Oh! yes - - I understand you perfectly."
<p>"I wish I might take this for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compliment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.748" formerWord="compliment" newWord="duty" score="0.748">duty</span>; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."
<p>"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="character" newWord="skin" score="0.704">skin</span> is more or less estimable than such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> as yours."
<p>"Lizzy,"cried her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>,"remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="manner" newWord="archness" score="0.672">archness</span> that you are suffered to do at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span>."
<p>"I did not know before,"continued Bingley immediately,"that you were a studier of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="character" newWord="skin" score="0.704">skin</span>. It must be an amusing <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>study</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.896" formerWord="study" newWord="dignity" score="0.896">dignity</span>."
<p>"Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.771" formerWord="advantage" newWord="necessity" score="0.771">necessity</span>."
<p>"The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="country" newWord="neighbourhood" score="0.868">neighbourhood</span>,"said Darcy,"can in general <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>supply</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.834" formerWord="supply" newWord="excite" score="0.834">excite</span> but a few subjects for such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>study</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.896" formerWord="study" newWord="dignity" score="0.896">dignity</span>.

<p>"But people themselves alter so much, that there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> new to be observed in them for ever."
<p>"Yes, indeed,"cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="manner" newWord="archness" score="0.672">archness</span> of mentioning a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="country" newWord="neighbourhood" score="0.868">neighbourhood</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span>."I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="country" newWord="neighbourhood" score="0.868">neighbourhood</span> as in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.809">bath</span>."
<p><span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Everybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.699" formerWord="Everybody" newWord="everything" score="0.699">Everything</span> was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="moment" newWord="morning" score="0.703">morning</span>, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>victory</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.656" formerWord="victory" newWord="lesser" score="0.656">lesser</span> over him, continued her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>triumph</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.849" formerWord="triumph" newWord="progress" score="0.849">progress</span>. 
<p>"I cannot see that London has any great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.771" formerWord="advantage" newWord="necessity" score="0.771">necessity</span> over the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="country" newWord="neighbourhood" score="0.868">neighbourhood</span>, for my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="part" newWord="mode" score="0.722">mode</span>, except the shops and public places. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="country" newWord="neighbourhood" score="0.868">neighbourhood</span> is a vast <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.538" formerWord="deal" newWord="yawn" score="0.538">yawn</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasanter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="pleasanter" newWord="used" score="0.757">used</span>, is it not, Mr. Bingley?"
<p>"When I am in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="country" newWord="neighbourhood" score="0.868">neighbourhood</span>,"he replied,"I never wish to leave it; and when I am in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.809">bath</span> it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."
<p>"Aye - - that is because you have the right <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disposition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="disposition" newWord="health" score="0.794">health</span>. But that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="military" score="0.766">military</span>,"looking at Darcy,"seemed to think the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="country" newWord="neighbourhood" score="0.868">neighbourhood</span> was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> at all."
<p>"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,"said Elizabeth, blushing for her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>."You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>variety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.878" formerWord="variety" newWord="portion" score="0.878">portion</span> of people to be met with in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="country" newWord="neighbourhood" score="0.868">neighbourhood</span> as in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.809">bath</span>, which you must acknowledge to be true."
<p>"Certainly, my dear, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nobody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="nobody" newWord="somebody" score="0.743">somebody</span> said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span>, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.

<p><span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">Anything</span> but <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>concern</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="concern" newWord="resentment" score="0.73">resentment</span> for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>countenance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="countenance" newWord="affectionate" score="0.762">affectionate</span>. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span> was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.581" formerWord="smile" newWord="listening" score="0.581">listening</span>. Elizabeth, for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="sake" newWord="amends" score="0.751">amends</span> of saying <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> that might turn her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>'s thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Longbourn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="Longbourn" newWord="rosings" score="0.89">Rosings</span> since her coming away. 
<p>"Yes, she called <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>yesterday</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.66" formerWord="yesterday" newWord="nonsensical" score="0.66">nonsensical</span> with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>.

<p>"Did Charlotte dine with you?"
<p>"No, she would go <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span>.
