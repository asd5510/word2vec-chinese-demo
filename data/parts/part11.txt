<p>"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."
<p>Elizabeth was forced to go.

<p>After this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>, Jane said no more of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indifference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="indifference" newWord="confidence" score="0.762">confidence</span>.

Elizabeth, who had a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.59" formerWord="letter" newWord="first" score="0.59">first</span> to write, went into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breakfast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="breakfast" newWord="tea" score="0.869">tea</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span> for that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="purpose" newWord="prepare" score="0.803">prepare</span> soon after <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="tea" newWord="breakfast" score="0.869">breakfast</span>; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>'s schemes. 
<p>But on returning to the drawing-room, when her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.59" formerWord="letter" newWord="first" score="0.59">first</span> was finished, she saw, to her infinite <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="surprise" newWord="dejected" score="0.605">dejected</span>, there was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="reason" newWord="objection" score="0.833">objection</span> to fear that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span> had been too ingenious for her.

<p>She then hastened away to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>, who had purposely broken up the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>card</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="card" newWord="collecting" score="0.804">collecting</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span>, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.

<p>In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.848" formerWord="conference" newWord="ceremonies" score="0.848">ceremonies</span> with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span> had been short and to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="purpose" newWord="prepare" score="0.803">prepare</span>.

<p>"You must not blame my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span>.

<p>"It taught me to hope,"said he,"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.

<p>Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied,"Yes, you know enough of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>frankness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.811" formerWord="frankness" newWord="judgement" score="0.811">judgement</span> to believe me capable of that.

<p>"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."
