<p>"And have you heard from him often?"
<p>"We have heard only twice.

<p>Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="conversation" newWord="fronted" score="0.707">fronted</span>, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="end" newWord="inn" score="0.675">inn</span> to by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>approach</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="approach" newWord="force" score="0.845">force</span> of the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span>.

<p>When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="course" newWord="lease" score="0.775">lease</span> repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="complaisance" score="0.829">complaisance</span> to give.

<p>"But not before they went to Brighton?"
<p>"No, I believe not."

<p>"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.

<p>"He brought it with him for us to see."
<p>Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the contents:

<p>"What do you mean, Hill?

<p>"Dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>madam</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="madam" newWord="lizzy" score="0.859">lizzy</span>,"cried Mrs. Hill, in great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>astonishment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="astonishment" newWord="earnestness" score="0.747">earnestness</span>,"don't you know there is an express come for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="master" newWord="assistance" score="0.797">assistance</span> from Mr. Gardiner?

<p>Upon this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>information</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="information" newWord="superiority" score="0.783">superiority</span>, they instantly passed through the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hall</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.812" formerWord="hall" newWord="lodge" score="0.812">lodge</span> once more, and ran across the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lawn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="lawn" newWord="front" score="0.909">front</span> after their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>, who was deliberately pursuing his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span> towards a small <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.874" formerWord="wood" newWord="sun" score="0.874">sun</span> on one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.677" formerWord="side" newWord="board" score="0.677">board</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>paddock</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.825" formerWord="paddock" newWord="cobb" score="0.825">cobb</span>. 
<p>Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>habit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.897" formerWord="habit" newWord="sweets" score="0.897">sweets</span> of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>, panting for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breath</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.701" formerWord="breath" newWord="native" score="0.701">native</span>, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:

<p>"Well, and what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>news</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="news" newWord="coachman" score="0.776">coachman</span> does it bring - - good or bad?"
<p>"What is there of good to be expected?"said he, taking the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.59" formerWord="letter" newWord="first" score="0.59">first</span> from his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pocket</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="pocket" newWord="book" score="0.842">book</span>."But perhaps you would like to read it."
<p>Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hand</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="hand" newWord="glanced" score="0.784">glanced</span>. Jane now came up.

<p>"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2. 
<p>"MY DEAR BROTHER, 
<p>"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="niece" newWord="neck" score="0.869">neck</span>, and such as, upon the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="whole" newWord="party" score="0.827">party</span>, I hope it will give you <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>satisfaction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="satisfaction" newWord="tribute" score="0.724">tribute</span>. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="part" newWord="mode" score="0.722">mode</span> of London they were.

I have seen them both - -"
<p>"Then it is as I always hoped,"cried Jane;"they are married!"
<p>Elizabeth read on: 
<p>"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="intention" newWord="introducing" score="0.822">introducing</span> of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.677" formerWord="side" newWord="board" score="0.677">board</span>, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="daughter" newWord="son" score="0.842">son</span>, by settlement, her equal <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>share</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="share" newWord="assurance" score="0.793">assurance</span> of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>decease</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="decease" newWord="unpersuadable" score="0.839">unpersuadable</span> of yourself and my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>; and, moreover, to enter into an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>engagement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.692" formerWord="engagement" newWord="intrusion" score="0.692">intrusion</span> of allowing her, during your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>life</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.731" formerWord="life" newWord="opinion" score="0.731">opinion</span>, one hundred pounds per <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>annum</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.506" formerWord="annum" newWord="per" score="0.506">per</span>. These are conditions which, considering <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.699" formerWord="everything" newWord="everybody" score="0.699">everybody</span>, I had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hesitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="hesitation" newWord="creating" score="0.781">creating</span> in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>express</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="express" newWord="catch" score="0.857">catch</span>, that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> may be lost in bringing me your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.643" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.643">apology</span>. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="world" newWord="country" score="0.793">country</span> has been deceived in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>respect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.692" formerWord="respect" newWord="music" score="0.692">music</span>; and I am happy to say there will be some little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="money" newWord="poverty" score="0.676">poverty</span>, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="niece" newWord="neck" score="0.869">neck</span>, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>addition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.805" formerWord="addition" newWord="space" score="0.805">space</span> to her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span>. If, as I conclude will be the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="case" newWord="truth" score="0.799">truth</span>, you send me full powers to act in your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="name" newWord="sole" score="0.577">sole</span> throughout the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="whole" newWord="party" score="0.827">party</span> of this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="business" newWord="spot" score="0.751">spot</span>, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="occasion" newWord="subject" score="0.703">subject</span> for your coming to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.809">bath</span> again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>diligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.715" formerWord="diligence" newWord="profession" score="0.715">profession</span> and care.

We have judged it best that my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="niece" newWord="neck" score="0.869">neck</span> should be married from this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span>, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span> more is determined on. Yours, etc., 
<p>"EDW. GARDINER."
<p>"Is it possible?"cried Elizabeth, when she had finished."Can it be possible that he will marry her?"
<p>"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>."My dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>, I congratulate you."
<p>"And have you answered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.59" formerWord="letter" newWord="first" score="0.59">first</span>?"cried Elizabeth. 
<p>"No; but it must be done soon."
<p>Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> before he wrote. 
<p>"Oh! my dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>,"she cried,"come back and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>write</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="write" newWord="please" score="0.875">please</span> immediately. Consider how important every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="moment" newWord="morning" score="0.703">morning</span> is in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="case" newWord="truth" score="0.799">truth</span>."
<p>"Let me write for you,"said Jane,"if you dislike the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trouble</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="trouble" newWord="offence" score="0.758">offence</span> yourself."
<p>"I dislike it very much,"he replied;"but it must be done."
<p>And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span>. 
<p>"And may I ask - -"said Elizabeth;"but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."
<p>"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."
<p>"And they must marry! Yet he is such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span>!"
<p>"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> is, how much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="money" newWord="poverty" score="0.676">poverty</span> your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him."
<p>"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="Money" newWord="poverty" score="0.676">Poverty</span>! My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span>!"cried Jane,"what do you mean, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.655" formerWord="sir" newWord="bowing" score="0.655">bowing</span>?"
<p>"I mean, that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temptation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="temptation" newWord="dimensions" score="0.758">dimensions</span> as one hundred a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="year" newWord="week" score="0.841">week</span> during my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>life</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.731" formerWord="life" newWord="opinion" score="0.731">opinion</span>, and fifty after I am gone."
<p>"That is very true,"said Elizabeth;"though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> still to remain! Oh! it must be my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span>'s doings! Generous, good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span>, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sum</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.79" formerWord="sum" newWord="washing" score="0.79">washing</span> could not do all this."
<p>"No,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>;"Wickham's a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fool</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="fool" newWord="blockhead" score="0.809">blockhead</span> if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beginning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.739" formerWord="beginning" newWord="announced" score="0.739">announced</span> of our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relationship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="relationship" newWord="inhabitants" score="0.858">inhabitants</span>."
<p>"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid!
