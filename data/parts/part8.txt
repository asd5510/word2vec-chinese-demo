<p>Mrs. Reynolds <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>respect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.692" formerWord="respect" newWord="music" score="0.692">music</span> for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intimation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="intimation" newWord="excess" score="0.868">excess</span> of her knowing her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="master" newWord="assistance" score="0.797">assistance</span>.

<p>Elizabeth coloured, and said:"A little."

He was very fond of them."
<p>This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them. 
<p>Mrs. Reynolds then directed their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="attention" newWord="eye" score="0.7">eye</span> to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.

<p>Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="pride" newWord="vanity" score="0.74">vanity</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="attachment" newWord="affection" score="0.743">affection</span>, had evidently great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.662" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="elasticity" score="0.662">elasticity</span> in talking of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="master" newWord="assistance" score="0.797">assistance</span> and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>.

<p>"Except,"thought Elizabeth,"when she goes to Ramsgate."
<p>"If your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="master" newWord="assistance" score="0.797">assistance</span> would marry, you might see more of him."
<p>"Yes, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.655" formerWord="sir" newWord="bowing" score="0.655">bowing</span>; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him."
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying,"It is very much to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>credit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="credit" newWord="acknowledgment" score="0.808">acknowledgment</span>, I am sure, that you should think so."

<p>"To be sure, Lizzy,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span>,"he is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>countenance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="countenance" newWord="affectionate" score="0.762">affectionate</span>, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?"
<p>Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span>. 
<p>"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,"replied her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span>."Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span>, as he might change his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.661" formerWord="mind" newWord="feelings" score="0.661">feelings</span> another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>, and warn me off his grounds."

<p>They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> to express her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>satisfaction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="satisfaction" newWord="tribute" score="0.724">tribute</span>, and prepare for such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="visitor" newWord="drawn" score="0.789">drawn</span>, when Bingley's quick <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="step" newWord="forbade" score="0.829">forbade</span> was heard on the stairs, and in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="moment" newWord="morning" score="0.703">morning</span> he entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span>.

<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>personage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.608" formerWord="personage" newWord="temptations" score="0.608">temptations</span> than to herself.

The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="niece" newWord="neck" score="0.869">neck</span> directed their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.8" formerWord="observation" newWord="jealousy" score="0.8">jealousy</span> towards each with an earnest though guarded <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inquiry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="inquiry" newWord="aid" score="0.794">aid</span>; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conviction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="conviction" newWord="persuasion" score="0.814">persuasion</span> that one of them at least knew what it was to love.

<p>Elizabeth, on her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.677" formerWord="side" newWord="board" score="0.677">board</span>, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.742" formerWord="object" newWord="evil" score="0.742">evil</span>, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="success" newWord="timidity" score="0.847">timidity</span>, for those to whom she endeavoured to give <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.662" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="elasticity" score="0.662">elasticity</span> were prepossessed in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>favour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="favour" newWord="situation" score="0.797">situation</span>. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased. 
<p>In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>; and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="manner" newWord="archness" score="0.672">archness</span>. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.729" formerWord="notion" newWord="aware" score="0.729">aware</span> that, as he looked at her, he was trying to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="trace" newWord="seek" score="0.807">seek</span> a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resemblance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="resemblance" newWord="sweetness" score="0.839">sweetness</span>.

On this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="point" newWord="subject" score="0.73">subject</span> she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>recollection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.895" formerWord="recollection" newWord="remembrance" score="0.895">remembrance</span> of Jane not untinctured by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tenderness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.878" formerWord="tenderness" newWord="delicacy" score="0.878">delicacy</span>, and a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.642" formerWord="wish" newWord="believe" score="0.642">believe</span> of saying more that might lead to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.72" formerWord="mention" newWord="expect" score="0.72">expect</span> of her, had he dared.

<p>Elizabeth was pleased to find his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>memory</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="memory" newWord="welfare" score="0.833">welfare</span> so exact; and he afterwards took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="occasion" newWord="subject" score="0.703">subject</span> to ask her, when unattended to by any of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="rest" newWord="field" score="0.794">field</span>, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn.

<p>It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>glimpse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.826" formerWord="glimpse" newWord="entertainment" score="0.826">entertainment</span>, she saw an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>expression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.855" formerWord="expression" newWord="air" score="0.855">air</span> of general <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>complaisance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="complaisance" newWord="separating" score="0.902">separating</span>, and in all that he said she heard an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="accent" newWord="zealous" score="0.783">zealous</span> so removed from hauteur or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disdain</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="disdain" newWord="professions" score="0.842">professions</span> of his companions, as convinced <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>her</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="her" newWord="his" score="0.799">his</span> that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>improvement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.884" formerWord="improvement" newWord="fixing" score="0.884">fixing</span> of manners which she had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>yesterday</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.66" formerWord="yesterday" newWord="nonsensical" score="0.66">nonsensical</span> witnessed however temporary its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>existence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.93" formerWord="existence" newWord="renewal" score="0.93">renewal</span> might prove, had at least outlived <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>.

<p>Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.

<p>"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span>, as they drove from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.809">bath</span>;"and really, upon serious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="consideration" newWord="succeeding" score="0.663">succeeding</span>, I am much more inclined than I was to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.755" formerWord="judge" newWord="deserve" score="0.755">deserve</span> as your eldest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span> does on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="matter" newWord="case" score="0.781">case</span>. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> should form such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="design" newWord="scheming" score="0.781">scheming</span> against a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="girl" newWord="natured" score="0.843">natured</span> who is by no means unprotected or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friendless</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.721" formerWord="friendless" newWord="help" score="0.721">help</span>, and who was actually staying in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>colonel</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.6" formerWord="colonel" newWord="fitzwilliam" score="0.6">fitzwilliam</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span>, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.855" formerWord="regiment" newWord="viscountess" score="0.855">viscountess</span>, after such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affront</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.752" formerWord="affront" newWord="mount" score="0.752">mount</span> to Colonel Forster? His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temptation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="temptation" newWord="dimensions" score="0.758">dimensions</span> is not adequate to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>risk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.801" formerWord="risk" newWord="destruction" score="0.801">destruction</span>!"
<p>"Do you really think so?"cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="moment" newWord="morning" score="0.703">morning</span>. 
<p>"Upon my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span>,"said Mrs. Gardiner,"I begin to be of your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="opinion" newWord="conduct" score="0.793">conduct</span>. It is really too great a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>violation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.825" formerWord="violation" newWord="gross" score="0.825">gross</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>decency</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="decency" newWord="deviation" score="0.759">deviation</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="honour" newWord="authority" score="0.759">authority</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="interest" newWord="particularity" score="0.791">particularity</span>, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ill</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.659" formerWord="ill" newWord="often" score="0.659">often</span> of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"
<p>"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="interest" newWord="particularity" score="0.791">particularity</span>; but of every other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neglect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="neglect" newWord="convenience" score="0.813">convenience</span> I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="case" newWord="truth" score="0.799">truth</span>?"
<p>"In the first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.653">house</span>,"replied Mr. Gardiner,"there is no absolute <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proof</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="proof" newWord="instance" score="0.808">instance</span> that they are not gone to Scotland."
<p>"Oh! but their removing from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chaise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.886" formerWord="chaise" newWord="coach" score="0.886">coach</span> into a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hackney</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="hackney" newWord="valley" score="0.792">valley</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coach</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="coach" newWord="principal" score="0.917">principal</span> is such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>presumption</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.824" formerWord="presumption" newWord="robert" score="0.824">robert</span>! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>road</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.941" formerWord="road" newWord="lane" score="0.941">lane</span>."
<p>"Well, then - - supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="purpose" newWord="prepare" score="0.803">prepare</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>concealment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.75" formerWord="concealment" newWord="decision" score="0.75">decision</span>, for no more exceptional <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="purpose" newWord="prepare" score="0.803">prepare</span>. It is not likely that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="money" newWord="poverty" score="0.676">poverty</span> should be very abundant on either <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.677" formerWord="side" newWord="board" score="0.677">board</span>; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland."
<p>"But why all this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>secrecy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="secrecy" newWord="principle" score="0.781">principle</span>? Why any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fear</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.786" formerWord="fear" newWord="use" score="0.786">use</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>detection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="detection" newWord="conveying" score="0.806">conveying</span>? Why must their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="marriage" newWord="anticipation" score="0.749">anticipation</span> be private? Oh, no, no - - this is not likely. His most particular <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span>, you see by Jane's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="account" newWord="opinion" score="0.68">opinion</span>, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span> without some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="money" newWord="poverty" score="0.676">poverty</span>. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia - - what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attraction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.865" formerWord="attraction" newWord="exquisite" score="0.865">exquisite</span> has she beyond <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>youth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="youth" newWord="professions" score="0.889">professions</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>health</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="health" newWord="understanding" score="0.857">understanding</span>, and good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="humour" newWord="humoured" score="0.868">humoured</span> that could make him, for her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="sake" newWord="amends" score="0.751">amends</span>, forego every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.788" formerWord="chance" newWord="article" score="0.788">article</span> of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>restraint</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.901" formerWord="restraint" newWord="condemnation" score="0.901">condemnation</span> the apprehensions of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disgrace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="disgrace" newWord="inconvenience" score="0.813">inconvenience</span> in the corps might throw on a dishonourable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>elopement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="elopement" newWord="gently" score="0.792">gently</span> with her, I am not able to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.755" formerWord="judge" newWord="deserve" score="0.755">deserve</span>; for I know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> of the effects that such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="step" newWord="forbade" score="0.829">forbade</span> might produce. But as to your other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>objection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="objection" newWord="reason" score="0.833">reason</span>, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="addresses" score="0.802">addresses</span>, from his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indolence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.714" formerWord="indolence" newWord="alertness" score="0.714">alertness</span> and the little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="attention" newWord="eye" score="0.7">eye</span> he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span>, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span> could do, in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="matter" newWord="case" score="0.781">case</span>."
<p>"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.699" formerWord="everything" newWord="everybody" score="0.699">everybody</span> but love of him as to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.741" formerWord="consent" newWord="furnish" score="0.741">furnish</span> to live with him on any terms other than <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="marriage" newWord="anticipation" score="0.749">anticipation</span>?"
<p>"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,"replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes,"that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="sense" newWord="breeding" score="0.758">breeding</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>decency</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="decency" newWord="deviation" score="0.759">deviation</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>virtue</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.882" formerWord="virtue" newWord="condemnation" score="0.882">condemnation</span> in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="point" newWord="subject" score="0.73">subject</span> should admit of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="doubt" newWord="harm" score="0.813">harm</span>. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>justice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.801" formerWord="justice" newWord="entreat" score="0.801">entreat</span>. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>twelvemonth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.755" formerWord="twelvemonth" newWord="communicating" score="0.755">communicating</span> - - she has been given up to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> but <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amusement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.811" formerWord="amusement" newWord="profit" score="0.811">profit</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>vanity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.821" formerWord="vanity" newWord="habits" score="0.821">habits</span>. She has been allowed to dispose of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> in the most idle and frivolous <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="manner" newWord="archness" score="0.672">archness</span>, and to adopt any opinions that came in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span>. Since the - - - - <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.877" formerWord="shire" newWord="woody" score="0.877">woody</span> were first quartered in Meryton, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> but love, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>flirtation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.736" formerWord="flirtation" newWord="mischievous" score="0.736">mischievous</span>, and officers have been in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>head</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="head" newWord="hand" score="0.703">hand</span>. She has been doing <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.699" formerWord="everything" newWord="everybody" score="0.699">everybody</span> in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>power</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="power" newWord="hereafter" score="0.688">hereafter</span> by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thinking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.734" formerWord="thinking" newWord="aware" score="0.734">aware</span> and talking on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span>, to give greater - - what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>charm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.872" formerWord="charm" newWord="hero" score="0.872">hero</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.739" formerWord="person" newWord="woman" score="0.739">woman</span> and address that can captivate a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span>."
<p>"But you see that Jane,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span>,"does not think so very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ill</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.659" formerWord="ill" newWord="often" score="0.659">often</span> of Wickham as to believe him capable of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attempt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="attempt" newWord="attribute" score="0.814">attribute</span>."
<p>"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conduct</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="conduct" newWord="opinion" score="0.793">opinion</span>, that she would think capable of such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attempt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="attempt" newWord="attribute" score="0.814">attribute</span>, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="sense" newWord="breeding" score="0.758">breeding</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span>; that he has neither <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>integrity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="integrity" newWord="boasted" score="0.796">boasted</span> nor <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="honour" newWord="authority" score="0.759">authority</span>; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating."
<p>"And do you really know all this?"cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="stronger" score="0.724">stronger</span> as to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mode</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.895" formerWord="mode" newWord="varieties" score="0.895">varieties</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="complaisance" score="0.829">complaisance</span> was all alive. 
<p>"I do indeed,"replied Elizabeth, colouring."I told you, the other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>, of his infamous <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="addresses" score="0.802">addresses</span> to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="manner" newWord="archness" score="0.672">archness</span> he spoke of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> who had behaved with such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>forbearance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.9" formerWord="forbearance" newWord="solitude" score="0.9">solitude</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>liberality</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.853" formerWord="liberality" newWord="slighting" score="0.853">slighting</span> towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>liberty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="liberty" newWord="ecclesford" score="0.753">ecclesford</span> - - which it is not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>worth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.744" formerWord="worth" newWord="novel" score="0.744">novel</span> while to relate; but his lies about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="whole" newWord="party" score="0.827">party</span> Pemberley <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span> are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="girl" newWord="natured" score="0.843">natured</span>. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>unpretending</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="unpretending" newWord="tranquil" score="0.799">tranquil</span> as we have found her."
<p>"But does Lydia know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> of this? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"
