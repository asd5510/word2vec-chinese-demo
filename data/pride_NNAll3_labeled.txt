<p>However little known the feelings or views of such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> may be on his first entering a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span>, this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="truth" newWord="case" score="0.799">case</span> is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>property</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.838" formerWord="property" newWord="suddenness" score="0.838">suddenness</span> of some one or other of their daughters. 
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet,"said his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.588" formerWord="lady" newWord="miss" score="0.588">miss</span> to him <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>,"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
<p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. 
<p>"But it is,"returned she;"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
<p>Mr. Bennet made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.643" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.643">apology</span>.

<p>"You want to tell me, and I have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>objection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="objection" newWord="reason" score="0.833">reason</span> to hearing it."
<p>This was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="invitation" newWord="representing" score="0.777">representing</span> enough. 
<p>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> of large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span> from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>north</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="north" newWord="unusually" score="0.937">unusually</span> of England; that he came down on Monday in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chaise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.886" formerWord="chaise" newWord="coach" score="0.886">coach</span> and four to see the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.653">house</span>, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>possession</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="possession" newWord="defiance" score="0.851">defiance</span> before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span> by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="end" newWord="inn" score="0.675">inn</span> of next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="week" newWord="night" score="0.852">night</span>."

<p>"Bingley."
<p>"Is he married or single?"
<p>"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> of large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span>; four or five thousand a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="year" newWord="week" score="0.841">week</span>. What a fine <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span> for our girls!"
<p>"How so? How can it affect them?"
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet,"replied his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.789">son</span>,"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
<p>"Is that his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="design" newWord="scheming" score="0.781">scheming</span> in settling here?"
<p>"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="Design" newWord="scheming" score="0.781">Scheming</span>! <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nonsense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.748" formerWord="Nonsense" newWord="reads" score="0.748">Reads</span>, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.53" formerWord="love" newWord="wise" score="0.53">wise</span> with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
<p>"I see no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="occasion" newWord="subject" score="0.703">subject</span> for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span>."
<p>"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>share</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="share" newWord="assurance" score="0.793">assurance</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="beauty" newWord="youth" score="0.858">youth</span>, but I do not pretend to be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span> extraordinary now. When a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span> has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thinking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.734" formerWord="thinking" newWord="aware" score="0.734">aware</span> of her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="beauty" newWord="youth" score="0.858">youth</span>."
<p>"In such cases, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span> has not often much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="beauty" newWord="youth" score="0.858">youth</span> to think of."
<p>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span>."
<p>"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
<p>"But consider your daughters. Only think what an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>establishment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.763" formerWord="establishment" newWord="unnatural" score="0.763">unnatural</span> it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="account" newWord="opinion" score="0.68">opinion</span>, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not."
<p>"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.741" formerWord="consent" newWord="furnish" score="0.741">furnish</span> to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span> for my little Lizzy."
<p>"I <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.741" formerWord="desire" newWord="dispose" score="0.741">dispose</span> you will do no such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span>. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="half" newWord="hour" score="0.792">hour</span> so handsome as Jane, nor <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="half" newWord="hour" score="0.792">hour</span> so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>preference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.885" formerWord="preference" newWord="errors" score="0.885">errors</span>."
<p>"They have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="none" newWord="matches" score="0.753">matches</span> of them much to recommend them,"replied he;"they are all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silly</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.863" formerWord="silly" newWord="clever" score="0.863">clever</span> and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> more of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quickness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.865" formerWord="quickness" newWord="falling" score="0.865">falling</span> than her sisters."
<p>"Mr. Bennet, how can you <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>abuse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.634" formerWord="abuse" newWord="estimating" score="0.634">estimating</span> your own children in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span>? You take <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="delight" newWord="sweets" score="0.854">sweets</span> in vexing me. You have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.798" formerWord="compassion" newWord="health" score="0.798">health</span> for my poor nerves."
<p>"You <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mistake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="mistake" newWord="pity" score="0.827">pity</span> me, my dear. I have a high <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>respect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.692" formerWord="respect" newWord="music" score="0.692">music</span> for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="consideration" newWord="succeeding" score="0.663">succeeding</span> these last twenty years at least."
<p>"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
<p>"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="year" newWord="week" score="0.841">week</span> come into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span>."
<p>"It will be no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>use</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.786" formerWord="use" newWord="fear" score="0.786">fear</span> to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
<p>"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."
<p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mixture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.878" formerWord="mixture" newWord="defiance" score="0.878">defiance</span> of quick parts, sarcastic <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="humour" newWord="humoured" score="0.868">humoured</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.871" formerWord="reserve" newWord="medium" score="0.871">medium</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>caprice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.871" formerWord="caprice" newWord="horror" score="0.871">horror</span>, that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>experience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="experience" newWord="lover" score="0.804">lover</span> of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.789">son</span> understand his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="character" newWord="skin" score="0.704">skin</span>.

<p>Chapter 2 
<p>
<p>Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.789">son</span> that he should not go; and till the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="evening" newWord="whole" score="0.802">whole</span> after the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="visit" newWord="longbourn" score="0.678">longbourn</span> was paid she had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>knowledge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="knowledge" newWord="delicacy" score="0.808">delicacy</span> of it. It was then disclosed in the following <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="manner" newWord="archness" score="0.672">archness</span>. Observing his second <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="daughter" newWord="son" score="0.842">son</span> employed in trimming a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.742" formerWord="hat" newWord="pocket" score="0.742">pocket</span>, he suddenly addressed her with: 
<p>"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."
<p>"We are not in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span> to know what Mr. Bingley likes,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span> resentfully,"since we are not to visit."
<p>"But you forget, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="mamma" newWord="ma" score="0.749">ma</span>,"said Elizabeth,"that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."
<p>"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span>. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span>, and I have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="opinion" newWord="conduct" score="0.793">conduct</span> of her."
<p>"No more have I,"said Mr. Bennet;"and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."
<p>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters. 
<p>"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="sake" newWord="amends" score="0.751">amends</span>!

<p>"Aye, so it is,"cried her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>,"and Mrs. Long does not come back till the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span> before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."
<p>"Then, my dear, you may have the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.771" formerWord="advantage" newWord="necessity" score="0.771">necessity</span> of your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span>, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her."
<p>"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?"

<p>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="part" newWord="mode" score="0.722">mode</span> of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="conversation" newWord="fronted" score="0.707">fronted</span> between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="dance" newWord="dine" score="0.792">dine</span> for a few minutes, to press his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span> to join it.

<p>"I certainly shall not.

<p>Mr. Bingley followed his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="advice" newWord="intentions" score="0.86">intentions</span>.

<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="evening" newWord="whole" score="0.802">whole</span> altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span>.

So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> of your set-downs.

<p>"He is just what a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> ought to be,"said she,"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sensible</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.717" formerWord="sensible" newWord="amiable" score="0.717">amiable</span>, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! - - so much ease, with such perfect good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breeding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="breeding" newWord="benevolent" score="0.823">benevolent</span>!"

<p>"Dear Lizzy!"

<p>"Certainly not - - at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.

<p>"But she does help him on, as much as her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="nature" newWord="degree" score="0.743">degree</span> will allow.

<p>"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="moment" newWord="morning" score="0.703">morning</span> should be employed in conversing together.

<p>"If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,"cried Bingley,"it would not make them one jot less agreeable."

<p>"Do you prefer reading to cards?"said he;"that is rather singular."
<p>"Miss Eliza Bennet,"said Miss Bingley,"despises cards.

<p>Elizabeth thanked him from her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.752" formerWord="heart" newWord="sister" score="0.752">sister</span>, and then walked towards the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="table" newWord="door" score="0.864">door</span> where a few books were lying.

<p>"It ought to be good,"he replied,"it has been the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>work</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.713" formerWord="work" newWord="betsey" score="0.713">betsey</span> of many generations."

<p>"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."
<p>"Upon my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span>, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purchase</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.695" formerWord="purchase" newWord="writer" score="0.695">writer</span> than by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>imitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="imitation" newWord="series" score="0.776">series</span>."
<p>Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="attention" newWord="eye" score="0.7">eye</span> for her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="book" newWord="pocket" score="0.842">pocket</span>; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>, to observe the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>game</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.877" formerWord="game" newWord="latter" score="0.877">latter</span>.

<p>"Nor I, I am sure,"said Miss Bingley. 
<p>"Then,"observed Elizabeth,"you must comprehend a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.538" formerWord="deal" newWord="yawn" score="0.538">yawn</span> in your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.701" formerWord="idea" newWord="consequence" score="0.701">consequence</span> of an accomplished <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.922">man</span>."

Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conduct</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="conduct" newWord="opinion" score="0.793">opinion</span> would be quite as dependent on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.788" formerWord="chance" newWord="article" score="0.788">article</span> as that of any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> I know; and if, as you were mounting your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>horse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="horse" newWord="niece" score="0.756">niece</span>, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span> were to say, ' Bingley, you had better stay till next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="week" newWord="night" score="0.852">night</span>, ' you would probably do it, you would probably not go - - and at another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span>, might stay a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>month</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.642" formerWord="month" newWord="thirteen" score="0.642">thirteen</span>."

<p>"I am exceedingly gratified,"said Bingley,"by your converting what my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span> says into a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compliment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.748" formerWord="compliment" newWord="duty" score="0.748">duty</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sweetness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.912" formerWord="sweetness" newWord="consciousness" score="0.912">consciousness</span> of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="temper" newWord="taste" score="0.781">taste</span>.

<p>"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>obstinacy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.788" formerWord="obstinacy" newWord="females" score="0.788">females</span> in adhering to it?"

<p>"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes.

Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>figure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.863" formerWord="figure" newWord="tender" score="0.863">tender</span> was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.

<p>Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.

<p>"Not at all,"was her answer;"but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span> of disappointing him will be to ask <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> about it."
<p>Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span>, and persevered therefore in requiring an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>explanation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="explanation" newWord="perusal" score="0.839">perusal</span> of his two motives.

<p>"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this - - though I have never liked him.

<p>"It is wonderful,"replied Wickham,"for almost all his actions may be traced to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="pride" newWord="vanity" score="0.74">vanity</span>; and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="pride" newWord="vanity" score="0.74">vanity</span> had often been his best <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span>.

<p>"Yes.

<p>After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:

<p>"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want abilities.

Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no."
<p>"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>history</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="history" newWord="disposing" score="0.854">disposing</span> of himself as he gave me last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>night</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="night" newWord="week" score="0.852">week</span>; names, facts, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.699" formerWord="everything" newWord="everybody" score="0.699">everybody</span> mentioned without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ceremony</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.832" formerWord="ceremony" newWord="corner" score="0.832">corner</span>.

<p>"I see what you are feeling,"replied Charlotte."You must be surprised, very much surprised - - so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.

<p>"You are too sensible a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="girl" newWord="natured" score="0.843">natured</span>, Lizzy, to fall in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.53" formerWord="love" newWord="wise" score="0.53">wise</span> merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.635" formerWord="speaking" newWord="lieutenant" score="0.635">lieutenant</span> openly.

I have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> to say against him; he is a most interesting young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span>; and if he had the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span> he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.

Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span> would depend on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resolution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="resolution" newWord="presence" score="0.845">presence</span> and good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conduct</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="conduct" newWord="opinion" score="0.793">opinion</span>, I am sure. You must not disappoint your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>."
<p>"My dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span>, this is being serious indeed."
<p>"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."
<p>"Well, then, you need not be under any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>alarm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.768" formerWord="alarm" newWord="resentment" score="0.768">resentment</span>.

<p>"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."
<p>"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.53" formerWord="love" newWord="wise" score="0.53">wise</span> with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.

Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy!

My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span>, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span> that where there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="affection" newWord="partiality" score="0.759">partiality</span>, young people are seldom withheld by immediate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="want" newWord="use" score="0.707">use</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span> from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wisdom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="wisdom" newWord="loving" score="0.676">loving</span> to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hurry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.708" formerWord="hurry" newWord="hungry" score="0.708">hungry</span>.

In short, I will do my best."
<p>"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span> of inviting him."
<p>"As I did the other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>,"said Elizabeth with a conscious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.581" formerWord="smile" newWord="listening" score="0.581">listening</span>:"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="account" newWord="opinion" score="0.68">opinion</span> that he has been so frequently invited this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="week" newWord="night" score="0.852">night</span>.

But really, and upon my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="honour" newWord="authority" score="0.759">authority</span>, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied."
<p>Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span> assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kindness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="kindness" newWord="health" score="0.839">health</span> of her hints, they parted; a wonderful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>instance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="instance" newWord="necessity" score="0.851">necessity</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="advice" newWord="intentions" score="0.86">intentions</span> being given on such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="point" newWord="subject" score="0.73">subject</span>, without being resented.

It was some days, however, before they received any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="invitation" newWord="representing" score="0.777">representing</span> thither - - for while there were visitors in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span>, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="week" newWord="night" score="0.852">night</span> after the gentlemen's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="arrival" newWord="entrance" score="0.866">entrance</span>, that they were honoured by such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="attention" newWord="eye" score="0.7">eye</span>, and then they were merely asked on leaving <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>church</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.867" formerWord="church" newWord="wilderness" score="0.867">wilderness</span> to come there in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="evening" newWord="whole" score="0.802">whole</span>.

Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ladyship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="ladyship" newWord="uncle" score="0.843">uncle</span> received them civilly, but it was plain that their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>company</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.633" formerWord="company" newWord="excusable" score="0.633">excusable</span> was by no means so acceptable as when she could get <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nobody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="nobody" newWord="somebody" score="0.743">somebody</span> else; and she was, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fact</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.692" formerWord="fact" newWord="concerned" score="0.692">concerned</span>, almost engrossed by her nephews, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.635" formerWord="speaking" newWord="lieutenant" score="0.635">lieutenant</span> to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.739" formerWord="person" newWord="woman" score="0.739">woman</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span>.

<p>Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy: 
<p>"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.771" formerWord="advantage" newWord="necessity" score="0.771">necessity</span> of a London <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="master" newWord="assistance" score="0.797">assistance</span>.

<p>Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.79" formerWord="cousin" newWord="ladyship" score="0.79">ladyship</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="praise" newWord="regardless" score="0.802">regardless</span>; but neither at that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="moment" newWord="morning" score="0.703">morning</span> nor at any other could she discern any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>symptom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.785" formerWord="symptom" newWord="coarseness" score="0.785">coarseness</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.53" formerWord="love" newWord="wise" score="0.53">wise</span>; and from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="whole" newWord="party" score="0.827">party</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="addresses" score="0.802">addresses</span> to Miss de Bourgh she derived this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>comfort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.738" formerWord="comfort" newWord="use" score="0.738">use</span> for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="relation" newWord="sisterly" score="0.866">sisterly</span>.

<p>Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>writing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="writing" newWord="purposely" score="0.791">purposely</span> to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="business" newWord="spot" score="0.751">spot</span> into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>village</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="village" newWord="centre" score="0.927">centre</span>, when she was startled by a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ring</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.739" formerWord="ring" newWord="orchestra" score="0.739">orchestra</span> at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="door" newWord="table" score="0.864">table</span>, the certain <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>signal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.697" formerWord="signal" newWord="past" score="0.697">past</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="visitor" newWord="drawn" score="0.789">drawn</span>.

<p>He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intrusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.709" formerWord="intrusion" newWord="affection" score="0.709">affection</span> by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within. 
<p>They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>danger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="danger" newWord="possibility" score="0.776">possibility</span> of sinking into total <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.736" formerWord="silence" newWord="rising" score="0.736">rising</span>. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span>, and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span> of their hasty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>departure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.939" formerWord="departure" newWord="chief" score="0.939">chief</span>, she observed: 
<p>"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!

He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?"
<p>"Perfectly so, I thank you."
<p>She found that she was to receive no other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.643" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.643">apology</span>, and, after a short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.647" formerWord="pause" newWord="watchful" score="0.647">watchful</span> added:

<p>"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> there in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>future</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.831" formerWord="future" newWord="walls" score="0.831">walls</span>.

<p>"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span> that he should give up the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.653">house</span> entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span> there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span> so much for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>convenience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.926" formerWord="convenience" newWord="impression" score="0.926">impression</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="spots" score="0.904">spots</span> as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>principle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.825" formerWord="principle" newWord="sound" score="0.825">sound</span>."
<p>"I should not be surprised,"said Darcy,"if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purchase</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.695" formerWord="purchase" newWord="writer" score="0.695">writer</span> offers."
<p>Elizabeth made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.643" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.643">apology</span>. She was afraid of talking longer of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span>; and, having <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> else to say, was now determined to leave the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trouble</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="trouble" newWord="offence" score="0.758">offence</span> of finding a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span> to him. 
<p>He took the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hint</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.659" formerWord="hint" newWord="drop" score="0.659">drop</span>, and soon began with,"This seems a very comfortable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span>.

<p>"I believe she did - - and I am sure she could not have bestowed her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kindness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="kindness" newWord="health" score="0.839">health</span> on a more grateful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.742" formerWord="object" newWord="evil" score="0.742">evil</span>."

<p>"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sensible</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.717" formerWord="sensible" newWord="amiable" score="0.717">amiable</span> women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.

He never said a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.538" formerWord="deal" newWord="yawn" score="0.538">yawn</span>, nor did she give herself the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trouble</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="trouble" newWord="offence" score="0.758">offence</span> of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="course" newWord="lease" score="0.775">lease</span> of their third <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rencontre</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.455" formerWord="rencontre" newWord="swell" score="0.455">swell</span> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions - - about her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.662" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="elasticity" score="0.662">elasticity</span> in being at Hunsford, her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.53" formerWord="love" newWord="wise" score="0.53">wise</span> of solitary walks, and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="opinion" newWord="conduct" score="0.793">conduct</span> of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.76" formerWord="happiness" newWord="conduct" score="0.76">conduct</span>; and that in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.635" formerWord="speaking" newWord="lieutenant" score="0.635">lieutenant</span> of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span>, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span>, he must mean an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>allusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.698" formerWord="allusion" newWord="affording" score="0.698">affording</span> to what might arise in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quarter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="quarter" newWord="opportunity" score="0.807">opportunity</span>.

<p>"And what arts did he use to separate them?"
<p>"He did not talk to me of his own arts,"said Fitzwilliam, smiling."He only told me what I have now told you."

<p>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="niece" newWord="neck" score="0.869">neck</span> with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.581" formerWord="smile" newWord="listening" score="0.581">listening</span>, but Elizabeth could not return it.

<p>Mrs. Reynolds <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>respect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.692" formerWord="respect" newWord="music" score="0.692">music</span> for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intimation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="intimation" newWord="excess" score="0.868">excess</span> of her knowing her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="master" newWord="assistance" score="0.797">assistance</span>.

<p>Elizabeth coloured, and said:"A little."
<p>"And do not you think him a very handsome <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="military" score="0.766">military</span>, ma'am?"

He was very fond of them."
<p>This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them. 
<p>Mrs. Reynolds then directed their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="attention" newWord="eye" score="0.7">eye</span> to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.

<p>Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="pride" newWord="vanity" score="0.74">vanity</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="attachment" newWord="affection" score="0.743">affection</span>, had evidently great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.662" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="elasticity" score="0.662">elasticity</span> in talking of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="master" newWord="assistance" score="0.797">assistance</span> and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>.

<p>"Except,"thought Elizabeth,"when she goes to Ramsgate."
<p>"If your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="master" newWord="assistance" score="0.797">assistance</span> would marry, you might see more of him."
<p>"Yes, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.655" formerWord="sir" newWord="bowing" score="0.655">bowing</span>; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him."
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying,"It is very much to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>credit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="credit" newWord="acknowledgment" score="0.808">acknowledgment</span>, I am sure, that you should think so."

<p>"There is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> a little stately in him, to be sure,"replied her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span>,"but it is confined to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>air</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.855" formerWord="air" newWord="expression" score="0.855">expression</span>, and is not unbecoming.

<p>"To be sure, Lizzy,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span>,"he is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>countenance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="countenance" newWord="affectionate" score="0.762">affectionate</span>, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?"
<p>Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span>.

She was quite amazed at her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>discomposure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.8" formerWord="discomposure" newWord="stepping" score="0.8">stepping</span>; but amongst other causes of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disquiet</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="disquiet" newWord="patient" score="0.753">patient</span>, she dreaded lest the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>partiality</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="partiality" newWord="compassion" score="0.789">compassion</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="brother" newWord="mother" score="0.851">mother</span> should have said too much in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>favour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="favour" newWord="situation" score="0.797">situation</span>; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>power</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="power" newWord="hereafter" score="0.688">hereafter</span> of pleasing would fail her. 
<p>She retreated from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>window</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.85" formerWord="window" newWord="table" score="0.85">table</span>, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span>, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="surprise" newWord="dejected" score="0.605">dejected</span> in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span> as made <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.699" formerWord="everything" newWord="everybody" score="0.699">everybody</span> worse. 
<p>Miss Darcy and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="brother" newWord="mother" score="0.851">mother</span> appeared, and this formidable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>introduction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.862" formerWord="introduction" newWord="fondest" score="0.862">fondest</span> took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.653">house</span>.

Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.8" formerWord="observation" newWord="jealousy" score="0.8">jealousy</span> of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span> from her beyond a monosyllable. 
<p>Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scale</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.815" formerWord="scale" newWord="breast" score="0.815">breast</span> than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>figure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.863" formerWord="figure" newWord="tender" score="0.863">tender</span> was formed, and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>appearance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.863" formerWord="appearance" newWord="disposal" score="0.863">disposal</span> womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="brother" newWord="mother" score="0.851">mother</span>; but there was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="sense" newWord="breeding" score="0.758">breeding</span> and good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="humour" newWord="humoured" score="0.868">humoured</span> in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>face</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.819" formerWord="face" newWord="eye" score="0.819">eye</span>, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.601" formerWord="observer" newWord="unfortunately" score="0.601">unfortunately</span> as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings. 
<p>They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> to express her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>satisfaction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="satisfaction" newWord="tribute" score="0.724">tribute</span>, and prepare for such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="visitor" newWord="drawn" score="0.789">drawn</span>, when Bingley's quick <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="step" newWord="forbade" score="0.829">forbade</span> was heard on the stairs, and in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="moment" newWord="morning" score="0.703">morning</span> he entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span>.

He inquired in a friendly, though general <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span>, after her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span>, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done. 
<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>personage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.608" formerWord="personage" newWord="temptations" score="0.608">temptations</span> than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span> before them, indeed, excited a lively <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="attention" newWord="eye" score="0.7">eye</span>. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="niece" newWord="neck" score="0.869">neck</span> directed their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.8" formerWord="observation" newWord="jealousy" score="0.8">jealousy</span> towards each with an earnest though guarded <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inquiry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="inquiry" newWord="aid" score="0.794">aid</span>; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conviction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="conviction" newWord="persuasion" score="0.814">persuasion</span> that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.588" formerWord="lady" newWord="miss" score="0.588">miss</span>'s sensations they remained a little in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="doubt" newWord="harm" score="0.813">harm</span>; but that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="military" score="0.766">military</span> was overflowing with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>admiration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="admiration" newWord="warmth" score="0.875">warmth</span> was evident enough. 
<p>Elizabeth, on her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.677" formerWord="side" newWord="board" score="0.677">board</span>, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.742" formerWord="object" newWord="evil" score="0.742">evil</span>, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="success" newWord="timidity" score="0.847">timidity</span>, for those to whom she endeavoured to give <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.662" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="elasticity" score="0.662">elasticity</span> were prepossessed in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>favour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="favour" newWord="situation" score="0.797">situation</span>. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased. 
<p>In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>; and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="manner" newWord="archness" score="0.672">archness</span>. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.729" formerWord="notion" newWord="aware" score="0.729">aware</span> that, as he looked at her, he was trying to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="trace" newWord="seek" score="0.807">seek</span> a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resemblance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="resemblance" newWord="sweetness" score="0.839">sweetness</span>. But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="addresses" score="0.802">addresses</span> to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.677" formerWord="side" newWord="board" score="0.677">board</span> that spoke particular <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.717" formerWord="regard" newWord="partner" score="0.717">partner</span>. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">Anything</span> occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>. On this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="point" newWord="subject" score="0.73">subject</span> she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>recollection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.895" formerWord="recollection" newWord="remembrance" score="0.895">remembrance</span> of Jane not untinctured by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tenderness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.878" formerWord="tenderness" newWord="delicacy" score="0.878">delicacy</span>, and a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.642" formerWord="wish" newWord="believe" score="0.642">believe</span> of saying more that might lead to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.72" formerWord="mention" newWord="expect" score="0.72">expect</span> of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="moment" newWord="morning" score="0.703">morning</span> when the others were talking together, and in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tone</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.754" formerWord="tone" newWord="somersetshire" score="0.754">somersetshire</span> which had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> of real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regret</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.714" formerWord="regret" newWord="fearing" score="0.714">fearing</span>, that it"was a very long <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> since he had had the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.662" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="elasticity" score="0.662">elasticity</span> of seeing her;"and, before she could reply, he added,"It is above eight months.

<p>Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="conversation" newWord="fronted" score="0.707">fronted</span>, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="end" newWord="inn" score="0.675">inn</span> to by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>approach</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="approach" newWord="force" score="0.845">force</span> of the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span>.

<p>When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="course" newWord="lease" score="0.775">lease</span> repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="complaisance" score="0.829">complaisance</span> to give.

<p>They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="affection" newWord="partiality" score="0.759">partiality</span> for her and all her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span>, told her that he meant to be in London the very next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>endeavour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.881" formerWord="endeavour" newWord="try" score="0.881">try</span> for recovering Lydia.

<p>"But not before they went to Brighton?"
<p>"No, I believe not."

<p>"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.

<p>"He brought it with him for us to see."
<p>Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the contents:

<p>"What do you mean, Hill?

<p>"Dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>madam</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="madam" newWord="lizzy" score="0.859">lizzy</span>,"cried Mrs. Hill, in great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>astonishment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="astonishment" newWord="earnestness" score="0.747">earnestness</span>,"don't you know there is an express come for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="master" newWord="assistance" score="0.797">assistance</span> from Mr. Gardiner?

<p>Upon this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>information</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="information" newWord="superiority" score="0.783">superiority</span>, they instantly passed through the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hall</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.812" formerWord="hall" newWord="lodge" score="0.812">lodge</span> once more, and ran across the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lawn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="lawn" newWord="front" score="0.909">front</span> after their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>, who was deliberately pursuing his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span> towards a small <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.874" formerWord="wood" newWord="sun" score="0.874">sun</span> on one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.677" formerWord="side" newWord="board" score="0.677">board</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>paddock</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.825" formerWord="paddock" newWord="cobb" score="0.825">cobb</span>. 
<p>Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>habit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.897" formerWord="habit" newWord="sweets" score="0.897">sweets</span> of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>, panting for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breath</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.701" formerWord="breath" newWord="native" score="0.701">native</span>, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:

<p>"Well, and what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>news</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="news" newWord="coachman" score="0.776">coachman</span> does it bring - - good or bad?"
<p>"What is there of good to be expected?"said he, taking the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.59" formerWord="letter" newWord="first" score="0.59">first</span> from his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pocket</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="pocket" newWord="book" score="0.842">book</span>."But perhaps you would like to read it."
<p>Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hand</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="hand" newWord="glanced" score="0.784">glanced</span>. Jane now came up.

<p>"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2. 
<p>"MY DEAR BROTHER, 
<p>"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="niece" newWord="neck" score="0.869">neck</span>, and such as, upon the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="whole" newWord="party" score="0.827">party</span>, I hope it will give you <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>satisfaction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="satisfaction" newWord="tribute" score="0.724">tribute</span>. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="part" newWord="mode" score="0.722">mode</span> of London they were.

I have seen them both - -"
<p>"Then it is as I always hoped,"cried Jane;"they are married!"
<p>Elizabeth read on: 
<p>"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="intention" newWord="introducing" score="0.822">introducing</span> of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.677" formerWord="side" newWord="board" score="0.677">board</span>, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="daughter" newWord="son" score="0.842">son</span>, by settlement, her equal <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>share</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="share" newWord="assurance" score="0.793">assurance</span> of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>decease</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="decease" newWord="unpersuadable" score="0.839">unpersuadable</span> of yourself and my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>; and, moreover, to enter into an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>engagement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.692" formerWord="engagement" newWord="intrusion" score="0.692">intrusion</span> of allowing her, during your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>life</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.731" formerWord="life" newWord="opinion" score="0.731">opinion</span>, one hundred pounds per <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>annum</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.506" formerWord="annum" newWord="per" score="0.506">per</span>. These are conditions which, considering <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.699" formerWord="everything" newWord="everybody" score="0.699">everybody</span>, I had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hesitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="hesitation" newWord="creating" score="0.781">creating</span> in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>express</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="express" newWord="catch" score="0.857">catch</span>, that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> may be lost in bringing me your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.643" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.643">apology</span>. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="world" newWord="country" score="0.793">country</span> has been deceived in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>respect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.692" formerWord="respect" newWord="music" score="0.692">music</span>; and I am happy to say there will be some little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="money" newWord="poverty" score="0.676">poverty</span>, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="niece" newWord="neck" score="0.869">neck</span>, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>addition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.805" formerWord="addition" newWord="space" score="0.805">space</span> to her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span>. If, as I conclude will be the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="case" newWord="truth" score="0.799">truth</span>, you send me full powers to act in your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="name" newWord="sole" score="0.577">sole</span> throughout the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="whole" newWord="party" score="0.827">party</span> of this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="business" newWord="spot" score="0.751">spot</span>, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="occasion" newWord="subject" score="0.703">subject</span> for your coming to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.809">bath</span> again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>diligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.715" formerWord="diligence" newWord="profession" score="0.715">profession</span> and care.

We have judged it best that my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="niece" newWord="neck" score="0.869">neck</span> should be married from this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span>, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span> more is determined on. Yours, etc., 
<p>"EDW. GARDINER."
<p>"Is it possible?"cried Elizabeth, when she had finished."Can it be possible that he will marry her?"
<p>"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>."My dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>, I congratulate you."
<p>"And have you answered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.59" formerWord="letter" newWord="first" score="0.59">first</span>?"cried Elizabeth. 
<p>"No; but it must be done soon."
<p>Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> before he wrote. 
<p>"Oh! my dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>,"she cried,"come back and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>write</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="write" newWord="please" score="0.875">please</span> immediately. Consider how important every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="moment" newWord="morning" score="0.703">morning</span> is in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="case" newWord="truth" score="0.799">truth</span>."
<p>"Let me write for you,"said Jane,"if you dislike the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trouble</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="trouble" newWord="offence" score="0.758">offence</span> yourself."
<p>"I dislike it very much,"he replied;"but it must be done."
<p>And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="house" newWord="room" score="0.722">room</span>. 
<p>"And may I ask - -"said Elizabeth;"but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."
<p>"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."
<p>"And they must marry! Yet he is such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span>!"
<p>"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> is, how much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="money" newWord="poverty" score="0.676">poverty</span> your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him."
<p>"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="Money" newWord="poverty" score="0.676">Poverty</span>! My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span>!"cried Jane,"what do you mean, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.655" formerWord="sir" newWord="bowing" score="0.655">bowing</span>?"
<p>"I mean, that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temptation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="temptation" newWord="dimensions" score="0.758">dimensions</span> as one hundred a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="year" newWord="week" score="0.841">week</span> during my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>life</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.731" formerWord="life" newWord="opinion" score="0.731">opinion</span>, and fifty after I am gone."
<p>"That is very true,"said Elizabeth;"though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> still to remain! Oh! it must be my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span>'s doings! Generous, good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span>, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sum</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.79" formerWord="sum" newWord="washing" score="0.79">washing</span> could not do all this."
<p>"No,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>;"Wickham's a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fool</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="fool" newWord="blockhead" score="0.809">blockhead</span> if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beginning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.739" formerWord="beginning" newWord="announced" score="0.739">announced</span> of our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relationship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="relationship" newWord="inhabitants" score="0.858">inhabitants</span>."
<p>"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid!

<p>It was not to be supposed that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> would give Lydia that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>embarrassment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="embarrassment" newWord="activity" score="0.89">activity</span> from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ease</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="ease" newWord="calmness" score="0.784">calmness</span> and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called"Mrs. Wickham"by each of them; and in the mean <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, she went after <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dinner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="dinner" newWord="breakfast" score="0.807">breakfast</span> to show her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ring</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.739" formerWord="ring" newWord="orchestra" score="0.739">orchestra</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>boast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.711" formerWord="boast" newWord="model" score="0.711">model</span> of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.

<p>"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span> off. Must it be so?"

<p>"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>winter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.79" formerWord="winter" newWord="bottom" score="0.79">bottom</span> is over."

<p>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.

<p>No <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>stay</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.764" formerWord="stay" newWord="brighton" score="0.764">brighton</span> would be so short; and she made the most of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> by visiting about with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="daughter" newWord="son" score="0.842">son</span>, and having very frequent parties at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span>.

<p>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="occasion" newWord="subject" score="0.703">subject</span>; no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> was to be put in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>competition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="competition" newWord="successful" score="0.793">successful</span> with him.

<p>One <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span>, soon after their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="arrival" newWord="entrance" score="0.866">entrance</span>, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth: 
<p>"Lizzy, I never gave you an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="account" newWord="opinion" score="0.68">opinion</span> of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="wedding" newWord="welcomed" score="0.784">welcomed</span>, I believe. You were not by, when I told <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="mamma" newWord="ma" score="0.749">ma</span> and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"
<p>"No really,"replied Elizabeth;"I think there cannot be too little said on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span>."
<p>"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement ' s, because Wickham's lodgings were in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>parish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.891" formerWord="parish" newWord="nation" score="0.891">nation</span>. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span> and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>church</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.867" formerWord="church" newWord="wilderness" score="0.867">wilderness</span>. Well, Monday <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span> came, and I was in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fuss</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.774" formerWord="fuss" newWord="careful" score="0.774">careful</span>! I was so afraid, you know, that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span>, all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> I was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dressing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="dressing" newWord="solitary" score="0.846">solitary</span>, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sermon</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.505" formerWord="sermon" newWord="gayer" score="0.505">gayer</span>. However, I did not hear above one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span> in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.765" formerWord="coat" newWord="shropshire" score="0.765">shropshire</span>."
<p>"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span> were horrid unpleasant all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> I was with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>foot</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.855" formerWord="foot" newWord="reaching" score="0.855">reaching</span> out of doors, though I was there a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.738" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="twelvemonth" score="0.738">twelvemonth</span>.

To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.774" formerWord="carriage" newWord="knock" score="0.774">knock</span> came to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="door" newWord="table" score="0.864">table</span>, my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> was called away upon <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="business" newWord="spot" score="0.751">spot</span> to that horrid <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="end" newWord="inn" score="0.675">inn</span> of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> was to give me away; and if we were beyond the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="hour" newWord="half" score="0.792">half</span>, we could not be married all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes ' <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, and then we all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>set</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.671" formerWord="set" newWord="whispering" score="0.671">whispering</span> out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="wedding" newWord="welcomed" score="0.784">welcomed</span> need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."
<p>"Mr. Darcy!"repeated Elizabeth, in utter <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amazement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="amazement" newWord="rising" score="0.845">rising</span>. 
<p>"Oh, yes! - - he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span> about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"
<p>"If it was to be secret,"said Jane,"say not another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.735">soul</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.73">point</span>. You may depend upon my seeking no further."
<p>"Oh! certainly,"said Elizabeth, though <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>burning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.867" formerWord="burning" newWord="heartfelt" score="0.867">heartfelt</span> with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="stronger" score="0.724">stronger</span>;"we will ask you no questions."
<p>"Thank you,"said Lydia,"for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."

His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="character" newWord="skin" score="0.704">skin</span> was to speak for itself.

But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.

<p>"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span> at once.

But he found, in reply to this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.764" formerWord="question" newWord="matter" score="0.764">matter</span>, that Wickham still cherished the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hope</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.661" formerWord="hope" newWord="suffice" score="0.661">suffice</span> of more effectually making his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.753">sense</span> by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="marriage" newWord="anticipation" score="0.749">anticipation</span> in some other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="country" newWord="neighbourhood" score="0.868">neighbourhood</span>.

<p>"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="course" newWord="lease" score="0.775">lease</span> wanted more than he could get; but at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>length</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.83" formerWord="length" newWord="taunton" score="0.83">taunton</span> was reduced to be reasonable. 
<p>"Every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span> being settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="step" newWord="forbade" score="0.829">forbade</span> was to make your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>street</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.837" formerWord="street" newWord="pulteney" score="0.837">pulteney</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="evening" newWord="whole" score="0.802">whole</span> before I came <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span>. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inquiry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="inquiry" newWord="aid" score="0.794">aid</span>, that your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span> was still with him, but would quit <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.809">bath</span> the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span>.

He did not leave his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="name" newWord="sole" score="0.577">sole</span>, and till the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span> it was only known that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="military" score="0.766">military</span> had called on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="business" newWord="spot" score="0.751">spot</span>. 
<p>"On Saturday he came again. Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span> was gone, your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span>, and, as I said before, they had a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.538" formerWord="deal" newWord="yawn" score="0.538">yawn</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>talk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.81" formerWord="talk" newWord="hear" score="0.81">hear</span> together. 
<p>"They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>express</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="express" newWord="catch" score="0.857">catch</span> was sent off to Longbourn. But our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="visitor" newWord="drawn" score="0.789">drawn</span> was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>obstinacy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.788" formerWord="obstinacy" newWord="females" score="0.788">females</span> is the real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>defect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.604" formerWord="defect" newWord="decree" score="0.604">decree</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="character" newWord="skin" score="0.704">skin</span>, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">Anything</span> was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> about it ), your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> would most readily have settled the whole. 
<p>"They battled it together for a long <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, which was more than either the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="military" score="0.766">military</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.588" formerWord="lady" newWord="miss" score="0.588">miss</span> concerned in it deserved. But at last your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.843">ladyship</span> was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>use</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.786" formerWord="use" newWord="fear" score="0.786">fear</span> to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="niece" newWord="neck" score="0.869">neck</span>, was forced to put up with only having the probable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>credit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="credit" newWord="acknowledgment" score="0.808">acknowledgment</span> of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.59" formerWord="letter" newWord="first" score="0.59">first</span> this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span> gave him great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.662" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="elasticity" score="0.662">elasticity</span>, because it required an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>explanation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="explanation" newWord="perusal" score="0.839">perusal</span> that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="praise" newWord="regardless" score="0.802">regardless</span> where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most. 
<p>"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>addition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.805" formerWord="addition" newWord="space" score="0.805">space</span> to her own settled upon her, and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>commission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.726" formerWord="commission" newWord="behindhand" score="0.726">behindhand</span> purchased. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="reason" newWord="objection" score="0.833">objection</span> why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.871" formerWord="reserve" newWord="medium" score="0.871">medium</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="want" newWord="use" score="0.707">use</span> of proper <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="consideration" newWord="succeeding" score="0.663">succeeding</span>, that Wickham's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="character" newWord="skin" score="0.704">skin</span> had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="truth" newWord="case" score="0.799">case</span> in this; though I doubt whether his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.871" formerWord="reserve" newWord="medium" score="0.871">medium</span>, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="anybody" newWord="myself" score="0.828">myself</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.871" formerWord="reserve" newWord="medium" score="0.871">medium</span>, can be answerable for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>event</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.861" formerWord="event" newWord="result" score="0.861">result</span>.

<p>"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="wedding" newWord="welcomed" score="0.784">welcomed</span> took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.653">house</span>, and all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="money" newWord="poverty" score="0.676">poverty</span> matters were then to receive the last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>finish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.67" formerWord="finish" newWord="attack" score="0.67">attack</span>. 
<p>"I believe I have now told you every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span>.

<p>Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.789">son</span> ' s. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> to us.

<p>"You may depend on it,"replied the other,"for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>night</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="night" newWord="week" score="0.852">week</span>; I saw her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>passing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="passing" newWord="crowded" score="0.847">crowded</span> by, and went out myself on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="purpose" newWord="prepare" score="0.803">prepare</span> to know the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="truth" newWord="case" score="0.799">case</span> of it; and she told me that it was certain true.

<p>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour.

<p>"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="aunt" newWord="uncle" score="0.806">uncle</span> told us of the present <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>report</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="report" newWord="division" score="0.866">division</span>; and I know I appeared distressed.

<p>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.

<p>His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.789">son</span> represented to him how absolutely necessary such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="attention" newWord="eye" score="0.7">eye</span> would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.

<p>"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.

But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sound</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.867" formerWord="sound" newWord="blood" score="0.867">blood</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>voice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="voice" newWord="countenance" score="0.704">countenance</span>; and when occasionally, unable to resist the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impulse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="impulse" newWord="efficacy" score="0.814">efficacy</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="stronger" score="0.724">stronger</span>, she raised her eyes to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>face</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.819" formerWord="face" newWord="eye" score="0.819">eye</span>, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.742" formerWord="object" newWord="evil" score="0.742">evil</span> but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ground</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.865" formerWord="ground" newWord="water" score="0.865">water</span>.

She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so. 
<p>"Could I expect it to be otherwise!"said she."Yet why did he come?"
<p>She was in no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="humour" newWord="humoured" score="0.868">humoured</span> for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="conversation" newWord="fronted" score="0.707">fronted</span> with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anyone</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.737" formerWord="anyone" newWord="anybody" score="0.737">anybody</span> but himself; and to him she had hardly <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>courage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="courage" newWord="endeavoured" score="0.793">endeavoured</span> to speak. 
<p>She inquired after his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>, but could do no more. 
<p>"It is a long <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,"said Mrs. Bennet. 
<p>He readily agreed to it. 
<p>"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say you meant to quit the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.653">house</span> entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.

Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ' Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet, ' without there being a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>syllable</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.785" formerWord="syllable" newWord="deliberately" score="0.785">deliberately</span> said of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="father" newWord="brother" score="0.846">brother</span>, or the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.653">house</span> where she lived, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span>.

Did you see it?"
<p>Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell. 
<p>"It is a delightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.757" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.757">body</span>, to be sure, to have a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="daughter" newWord="son" score="0.842">son</span> well married,"continued her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>,"but at the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span> from me.

His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.855" formerWord="regiment" newWord="viscountess" score="0.855">viscountess</span> is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the - - - - <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.877" formerWord="shire" newWord="woody" score="0.877">woody</span>, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."
<p>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>misery</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="misery" newWord="dread" score="0.902">dread</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shame</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="shame" newWord="observations" score="0.843">observations</span>, that she could hardly keep her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>seat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="seat" newWord="neck" score="0.828">neck</span>.

A few weeks, he believed. 
<p>"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>,"I beg you will come here, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shoot</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.785" formerWord="shoot" newWord="plymouth" score="0.785">plymouth</span> as many as you please on Mr. Bennet's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="manor" newWord="accident" score="0.676">accident</span>. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."

<p>When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>civility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="civility" newWord="insignificance" score="0.803">insignificance</span>, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>.

<p>As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interruption</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="interruption" newWord="gallery" score="0.827">gallery</span> on those subjects that must deaden them more.

<p>They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span> to all the happy schemes, which the good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="humour" newWord="humoured" score="0.868">humoured</span> and common <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>politeness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.801" formerWord="politeness" newWord="passion" score="0.801">passion</span> of Bingley, in half an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="hour" newWord="half" score="0.792">half</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="visit" newWord="longbourn" score="0.678">longbourn</span>, had revived. 
<p>On Tuesday there was a large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span> assembled at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Longbourn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="Longbourn" newWord="rosings" score="0.89">Rosings</span>; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>credit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="credit" newWord="acknowledgment" score="0.808">acknowledgment</span> of their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>punctuality</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="punctuality" newWord="accommodation" score="0.86">accommodation</span> as sportsmen, were in very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.653">house</span>, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>. Her prudent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span>, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="round" newWord="table" score="0.799">table</span>, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her. 
<p>Elizabeth, with a triumphant <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sensation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="sensation" newWord="virtue" score="0.776">virtue</span>, looked towards his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span>.

She knew how little such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="situation" newWord="understanding" score="0.827">understanding</span> would give <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.662" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="elasticity" score="0.662">elasticity</span> to either, or make either appear to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.771" formerWord="advantage" newWord="necessity" score="0.771">necessity</span>.

<p>She was in hopes that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="evening" newWord="whole" score="0.802">whole</span> would afford some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="quarter" score="0.807">quarter</span> of bringing them together; that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="whole" newWord="party" score="0.827">party</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="visit" newWord="longbourn" score="0.678">longbourn</span> would not pass away without enabling them to enter into <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.702">anything</span> more of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="conversation" newWord="fronted" score="0.707">fronted</span> than the mere ceremonious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>salutation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="salutation" newWord="abundantly" score="0.724">abundantly</span> attending his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>entrance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="entrance" newWord="departure" score="0.938">departure</span>.

<p>"If he does not come to me, then,"said she,"I shall give him up for ever."
<p>The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="round" newWord="table" score="0.799">table</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="table" newWord="door" score="0.864">door</span>, where Miss Bennet was making <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="tea" newWord="breakfast" score="0.869">breakfast</span>, and Elizabeth pouring out the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coffee</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="coffee" newWord="shoulder" score="0.773">shoulder</span>, in so close a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confederacy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.69" formerWord="confederacy" newWord="alas" score="0.69">alas</span> that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.873" formerWord="chair" newWord="neck" score="0.873">neck</span>. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whisper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.571" formerWord="whisper" newWord="hurry" score="0.571">hurry</span>:

<p>Darcy had walked away to another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="part" newWord="mode" score="0.722">mode</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="room" newWord="street" score="0.743">street</span>.

<p>She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coffee</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="coffee" newWord="shoulder" score="0.773">shoulder</span> cup himself; and she seized the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="quarter" score="0.807">quarter</span> of saying:

<p>"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."
<p>"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"
<p>"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."
<p>She could think of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="success" newWord="timidity" score="0.847">timidity</span>.

<p>When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>'s rapacity for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whist</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="whist" newWord="immovable" score="0.802">immovable</span> players, and in a few moments after seated with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="rest" newWord="field" score="0.794">field</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span>.

<p>Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>supper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="supper" newWord="reaching" score="0.902">reaching</span>; but their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.774" formerWord="carriage" newWord="knock" score="0.774">knock</span> was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="quarter" score="0.807">quarter</span> of detaining them. 
<p>"Well girls,"said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,"What say you to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>?

And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="beauty" newWord="youth" score="0.858">youth</span>. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? ' Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last. ' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>creature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="creature" newWord="fellow" score="0.775">fellow</span> as ever lived - - and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."
<p>Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="addresses" score="0.802">addresses</span> to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.771" formerWord="advantage" newWord="necessity" score="0.771">necessity</span> to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="family" newWord="happiness" score="0.663">happiness</span>, when in a happy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="humour" newWord="humoured" score="0.868">humoured</span>, were so far beyond <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="reason" newWord="objection" score="0.833">objection</span>, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>, to make his proposals. 
<p>"It has been a very agreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.84">morning</span>,"said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth."The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.827">whole</span> seemed so well selected, so suitable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="one" newWord="either" score="0.568">either</span> with the other. I hope we may often meet again."
<p>Elizabeth smiled. 
<p>"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="conversation" newWord="fronted" score="0.707">fronted</span> as an agreeable and sensible young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span>, without having a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.642" formerWord="wish" newWord="believe" score="0.642">believe</span> beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="design" newWord="scheming" score="0.781">scheming</span> of engaging my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="affection" newWord="partiality" score="0.759">partiality</span>.

<p>"You are very cruel,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>,"you will not let me <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.581" formerWord="smile" newWord="listening" score="0.581">listening</span>, and are provoking me to it every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="moment" newWord="morning" score="0.703">morning</span>."
<p>"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"
<p>"And how impossible in others!"
<p>"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"
<p>"That is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.764" formerWord="question" newWord="matter" score="0.764">matter</span> which I hardly know how to answer.

<p>
<p>A few days after this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="visit" newWord="longbourn" score="0.678">longbourn</span>, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="friend" newWord="sister" score="0.769">sister</span> had left him that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span> for London, but was to return <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span> in ten days <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>. He sat with them above an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="hour" newWord="half" score="0.792">half</span>, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>concern</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="concern" newWord="resentment" score="0.73">resentment</span>, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere. 
<p>"Next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> you call,"said she,"I hope we shall be more lucky."
<p>He should be particularly happy at any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="quarter" score="0.807">quarter</span> of waiting on them. 
<p>"Can you come to-morrow?"
<p>Yes, he had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>engagement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.692" formerWord="engagement" newWord="intrusion" score="0.692">intrusion</span> at all for to-morrow; and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="invitation" newWord="representing" score="0.777">representing</span> was accepted with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>alacrity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.877" formerWord="alacrity" newWord="acquaint" score="0.877">acquaint</span>. 
<p>He came, and in such very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span> that the ladies were <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="none" newWord="matches" score="0.753">matches</span> of them dressed.

<p>"We will be down as soon as we can,"said Jane;"but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="half" newWord="hour" score="0.792">hour</span> an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="hour" newWord="half" score="0.792">half</span> ago."

<p>But when her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span> was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters. 
<p>The same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anxiety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.834" formerWord="anxiety" newWord="guest" score="0.834">guest</span> to get them by themselves was visible again in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="evening" newWord="whole" score="0.802">whole</span>. After <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="tea" newWord="breakfast" score="0.869">breakfast</span>, Mr. Bennet retired to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>library</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="library" newWord="opposite" score="0.804">opposite</span>, as was his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>custom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="custom" newWord="advantage" score="0.762">advantage</span>, and Mary went up stairs to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>instrument</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="instrument" newWord="campbells" score="0.916">campbells</span>. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.689" formerWord="time" newWord="day" score="0.689">day</span>, without making any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.926" formerWord="impression" newWord="convenience" score="0.926">convenience</span> on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said,"What is the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="matter" newWord="case" score="0.781">case</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="mamma" newWord="ma" score="0.749">ma</span>?

<p>"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."
<p>Elizabeth was forced to go. 
<p>"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span>, as soon as she was in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hall</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.812" formerWord="hall" newWord="lodge" score="0.812">lodge</span>."Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room."

<p>"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.

<p>"You can now have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> further to say,"she resentfully answered."You have insulted me in every possible <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>method</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.877" formerWord="method" newWord="ingenuity" score="0.877">ingenuity</span>.

<p>And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ladyship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="ladyship" newWord="uncle" score="0.843">uncle</span> was highly incensed.

<p>At <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>night</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="night" newWord="week" score="0.852">week</span> she opened her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.752" formerWord="heart" newWord="sister" score="0.752">sister</span> to Jane. Though <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>suspicion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="suspicion" newWord="article" score="0.795">article</span> was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here. 
<p>"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! - - engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."
<p>"This is a wretched <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beginning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.739" formerWord="beginning" newWord="announced" score="0.739">announced</span> indeed! My sole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dependence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="dependence" newWord="vicinity" score="0.846">vicinity</span> was on you; and I am sure <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nobody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="nobody" newWord="somebody" score="0.743">somebody</span> else will believe me, if you do not.

He still loves me, and we are engaged."
<p>Jane looked at her doubtingly."Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him."
<p>"You know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="matter" newWord="case" score="0.781">case</span>. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.

<p>Miss Bennet still looked all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amazement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="amazement" newWord="rising" score="0.845">rising</span>. Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="truth" newWord="case" score="0.799">case</span>. 
<p>"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,"cried Jane."My dear, dear Lizzy, I would - - I do congratulate you - - but are you certain? forgive the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.764" formerWord="question" newWord="matter" score="0.764">matter</span> - - are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"
<p>"There can be no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="doubt" newWord="harm" score="0.813">harm</span> of that.

Shall you like to have such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="brother" newWord="mother" score="0.851">mother</span>?"
<p>"Very, very much. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">Anything</span> could give either Bingley or myself more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="delight" newWord="sweets" score="0.854">sweets</span>. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.74" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.74">anybody</span> rather than marry without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="affection" newWord="partiality" score="0.759">partiality</span>. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"
<p>"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all."
<p>"What do you mean?"
<p>"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry."
<p>"My dearest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.889">mother</span>, now be serious.

Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"
<p>"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>date</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="date" newWord="earliest" score="0.806">earliest</span> it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."
<p>Another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>entreaty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.774" formerWord="entreaty" newWord="ravenshaw" score="0.774">ravenshaw</span> that she would be serious, however, produced the desired <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>effect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="effect" newWord="examination" score="0.814">examination</span>; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="attachment" newWord="affection" score="0.743">affection</span>. When convinced on that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>article</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.826" formerWord="article" newWord="delay" score="0.826">delay</span>, Miss Bennet had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="nothing" newWord="anything" score="0.688">anything</span> further to wish. 
<p>"Now I am quite happy,"said she,"for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>value</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="value" newWord="proposal" score="0.852">proposal</span> for him.

But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you."
<p>Elizabeth told her the motives of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>secrecy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="secrecy" newWord="principle" score="0.781">principle</span>.

<p>Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proposal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="proposal" newWord="unconscious" score="0.866">unconscious</span>; yet was really vexed that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.889">sister</span> should be always giving him such an epithet. 
<p>As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>warmth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.877" formerWord="warmth" newWord="enjoyment" score="0.877">enjoyment</span>, as left no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="doubt" newWord="harm" score="0.813">harm</span> of his good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>information</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="information" newWord="superiority" score="0.783">superiority</span>; and he soon afterwards said aloud,"Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.603" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.603">place</span> again to-day?"
<p>"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,"said Mrs. Bennet,"to walk to Oakham Mount this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.84" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.84">day</span>.

<p>"It may do very well for the others,"replied Mr. Bingley;"but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?"Kitty owned that she had rather stay at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="home" newWord="netherfield" score="0.702">netherfield</span>.

As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying: 
<p>"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> all to yourself.
